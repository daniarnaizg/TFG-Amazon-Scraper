The large fits my 6'1\" frame correctly.", "My minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.", "For the price, these are a fantastic buy.", "You are looking at these because you want some white t-shirts but want the cheapest set you can find. These shirts are \"good enough\" for an undershirtz provided that you don't care if they shrink after one wash. If you just wear them under your work shirt and take them off when you get home, these are perfect. If you want to wear these as a shirt by itself, I'm not so sure this is the best option. Maybe I just shouldn't have put this in the dryer but then again other shirts I've done this with haven't shrunk so much.", "bad! bad! bad! Very bad quality under-shirts with extremely thin material. All shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere. Never again any product from Gildan!", "The shirts are comfortable, but the quality control is bad.  One of the shirts had a little white sticker with a red arrow that pointed to a hole in the shirt. Clearly the QC department marked that as a defective shirt, but it was still included in the package even though it was marked as defective.", "A couple weeks ago I had bought a pack of the same Gildan shirts at Target and one of the shirts had a 1\" diameter hole in it, so apparently this is an ongoing problem with quality control.", "So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting  or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.", "Good price for a 6pack of undershirts. Im 6'3, on the lean side, with a basketball in front.", "A top notch high end Tshirt, I can get by with a true American large.", "I ordered an XL on these, expecting a good bit of shrink, like I do other bulk pack T's.", "The XL fits me absolutely perfect out of pack.

But so does every other cheap bulk pack non-tall shirt.", "I really probably should've went with a tall size, but these will do fine for an undershirt.", "Nice summer weight.", "2nd time ordering these, these are solid shirts. I mean not sure what some people expect from these after reading the reviews. I ordered the 2x which fit me nicely. I wear these mostly for undershirts and they are just fine. SO if you are looking for some inexpensive shirts, might as well buy these lol", "Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts are very comfortable very well made and I would highly recommend them I wear a lot of white shirts and comfort bility and the style and fabric of the shirt is very important to me I  Used to always  Hans but they've got to be very expensive and I don't mind the price but the quality has also been reduced but Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts  Suppress my expectations and if I could give them a 10 star I would I would highly recommend", "Good value for well-made T-shirts. These shirts are all I will buy now. Material is excellent and they do not shrink much.", "The T shirts seem to be of comparable quality to the Hanes shirt I usually get. I haven't washed them yet to see how much they'll shrink. I'm sure they'll shrink some because they are cotton. I consider myself to be a careful shopper so I was worried these shirts weren't going to be good quality because of the price. I've now learned that Hanes charges too much for similar quality."]},
{"asin": "B077ZMKWVM", "comments": ["The shirt is for people with a 34-36 inch chest and I am at about 39 inches yet the shirt still hangs a bit loose on me by a few inches around the chest and a bit about the arms. Otherthan that, still a great relatively form fitting shirt and for that price it was a no brainer.", "I'm highly impressed. The shirts are well-made. They're durable and, if any discrepancy in size, they fit maybe just slightly large and noticeably long, and that's preferable, in my opinion, to being just a little too small. I like getting more for my hard-earned money and Gildan undershirts seem, to me, an absolute no-brainer of a high-value bargain. The value is really just that impressive. Great product and great value - thanx!", "All shows in comparison. When I bought Banana Republic soft tee (yes, it is $20), I realized that I was wasting money on Guildan t-shirts. Day and night!  Now I cannot even put on Guildan t-shirts and will be disposing of them, since I see no use for the product. After using Banana Republic for few days, Guildan t-shirts seem harsh and deformed, not soft on skin, heavy, and very uncomfortable comparable to Banana Republic soft tees. The difference is obviously in much much quality of fabric and I guess we need to pay more for higher quality. The feel is more like Underarmour, another good option, but also more expensive. I wish Amazon focused more on quality vendors, reviews often don't tell much since they are often produced by people who did not have a chance to try high good quality products. It's all about price.", "The shirts say they are 100% Cotten but I don\u2019t believe I have ever felt such rough scratchy cotton. I have had these shirts for a few weeks now and they have been washed multiple times and are still scratchy. I also put one on this morning and it has a hole in the arm pit. I would not suggest buying these and I will not buy them again.", "These are the best 100% cotton white t-shirts ever. I was very disappointed in the Hanes shirts now sold at my local Target. They ALWAYS try to blend polyester into them, (probably to save money). But here in the desert you can't wear polyester. Makes you sweat like a greased pig.", "I usually purchase Hanes for my husband but he goes through white shirts like water since after a few weeks of washing they\u2019re already starting to wear down and the collar starts fraying. Figured I\u2019d give these a shot for the price and we both love them! I\u2019ve washed many many times and so far so good. Much better quality than I was expecting and a great value. Will be purchasing again. Remember this is an undershirt. They\u2019re supposed to be a bit thinner. If you\u2019re looking for a white shirt to wear out Kirkland\u2019s pack of white t\u2019s are super thick, durable & longer in length which is great for wearing alone. If you\u2019re looking for an undershirt this pack of Gildan\u2019s are PERFECT! I plan to stock up on these!", "4-Star only because they are not made of Egyptian cotton, or the closest in quality, Pema cotton. Of course, Egyptian cotton would have quadruple the price. But would have also given them 5-Star rating.", "The feel is definitely smooth first time use, but once washed, that will change. That is the difference between Egyptian cotton and the rest of the world's cotton. I have purchased T-shirts while on a trip to Egypt. I have had them for 6 years now, and they are still as soft as the day I bought them from STIA in a Cairo suburban mall. They were ridiculously cheap, and will probably last another ten years. Had I known, I would have purchased the entire stock at the time.", "These shirts are perfect fit. Made in Honduras, one will not expect them to last more than a year, but they are inexpensive and replacing them should not bankrupt me. I bought two dozen this time just because Amazon had them on sale.", "They almost made a good T-shirt. Anyone that wears undershirts knows you can't review them until you've washed and dried them to determine what size undershirt you end up with. Shrinkage is about average for these undershirts, but the sleeves are cut too short to properly function as an undershirt should.  After washing these shirts in hot water and fully drying them, the sleeves just don't feel right and defeat the whole purpose of wearing an undershirt since your armpits aren't fully covered.  You'd think an undershirt manufacturer would know that sleeve length is critical and would then take measures to get that measurement correct.  The overall length of the undershirt is good in that it's a little longer than a non-undershirt T-shirt, which means it's more likely to remain tucked in as you move around.  If your shoulder width is on the narrow side, then these shirts may fit you well.  If your shoulder width is average or above, then order a size up to account for shrinkage.  Otherwise, I can't recommend these shirts due to the sleeves being too short.  Also, the shirt material itself has a stiffer, more canvas-like feel than undershirts from other brands. This stiffness decreases after washing and drying, but still remains.", "I always like to wear undershirts. And I usually buy them at the wholesale warehouses. But sometimes I buy them for a premium. Honestly I would spend more money and buy them elsewhere. These feel very cheap and they get dirty right away. Even after a wash, they look like you got dust on them. Would not recommend nor buy them again.", "This is my second set of these.  Great product.  Great price.  Wash well, do not over shrink, and have worn very well, even when wearing as just a tee-shirt rather than an undershirt.", "As with all white shirts around your collor, they are subjuct to staining, depending on your skin type. (Oilly Italian here, so i just use a mixture of Dawn, hydrogen peroxide and backing powder (found on Pintrest) ... put on any yellowed areas with an old toothbrush...scrub it in some... try to let sit for at least an hour, or preferably over night, and then just wash as normal with other whites (HOT water)... PS: have a high efficency front-loading washer, where you can not use liquid bleach, or the rubber seals will begin to prematurely fail.  I find \u201cBorax\u201d or \u201cArm&Hammer Baking Powder Laundry Booster\u201d works great as a substitute.  To like to use the extra rinse cycle when using these harsher chemicals."]},

I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked as well.", "I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.", "Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.", "Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer. Also, I think that the Gilden shrank significantly in the first wash. The shrinkage seemed to be in t in the shoulders and in the length. I would say that the T-shirt went from a large to a medium. It still fits but I had wanted a large T-shirt, not a medium.  I washed the T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.", "Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.", "I hope that this review is helpful to you.", "My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.", "Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.", "So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.", "Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.", "A great find!", "I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.", "I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.", "I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.", "FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own.

I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.", "SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.", "These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.", "Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like. I am a throw it in the laundry and go type so I needed bigger so I could shrink it. I am 250 lbs and 5'11 with a beer gut. I got the 2x and it fit just a touch too big and after 1 wash it is perfect. After a few more washes I might have wished on a 3x but not sure yet. As of now they are perfect and am happy. Only thing that will change when I order more is color and  possible size upgrade if it continues to shrink.", "Size was correct. Shirt is soft and comfortable as you would expect of cotton. I will be buying more of these.", "These are my husband's favorite shirts, they are thick and durable. We will be buying more.", "Purchased as a sleeping shirt for my husband.  From other reviews, it was recommended that I order a larger size, which I did.  They are very comfortable and he loves the fit!", "Very disappointed with these T's. After the first washing the bottom hems unraveled. Also the material is super scratchy. They are pretty much useless to wear un-tucked due to the unraveled hems.I have purchased much less costly white T-shirts from Gildan and was quite pleased with them.

I've searched everywhere for years for black midweight undershirts close to the ones JCPenney used to sell. And I am so glad I gave these from Gildan a shot! The fit is perfect and the shirts aren't see through. They do a good job of hiding your skin! I bought a multipack of undershirts from Gildan but these are definitely thicker! They also last quite a while! No issues with armpit seams tearing of hems rolling up. Great for self-conscious Big & Tall men! I will definitely be ordering more!", "They use the words \"Soft premium cotton\", but I don't think Gildan knows what soft is.  I've ordered many different brands of T-Shirts in my quest to find a favorite.  These are by far the roughest feeling yet(before and after wash/dry).  These will either end up being cut into rags or in the clothes donation bin.", "I was very disappointed with this shirt. And I was extremely disappointed with the delivery time which took over 3 weeks. The shirt fits very tight and it's short. I only wore it one time and I cannot wear again because my belly shows. So very disappointing.", "Right off: If I had tried them on before laundering, I would have returned these shirts.", "They are so uncomfortable. I got an XL because I don't like tight shirts. These have enough room in the body, but if your body doesn't completely fill out the shirt (which would make it fairly snug), it does not hang right, so it feels like the sleeves are on backward. Like this: If I have my arms straight down, it's fine; and if I move my arm backward, it's fine; but if I raise my arm forward, it immediately pulls taut on the sleeve because I don't have a huge chest pushing the front of the shirt way out.", "I've been wearing XLs for a while and I've only experienced this kind of cut once, with a Hanes T-shirt. I guess if I was bigger it would make things line up properly, but then the shirt would also feel too small. I have other shirts from this brand but this cut is much different.", "They run a little on the short side, which is another reason I went with XL.", "That said: The material is really good - heavy and you can tell it will last.

I have a pretty bid neck and after drying the shirts I have to stretch them out a bit or they feel like they are choking me, but that is more of a problem with my neck than the shirt. They are soft enough. For $5 a shirt, you cant go wrong.", "I bought these to wear under a shirt or sweater with the neck showing.", "The Good: They are long enough which is a problem for some colored T-shirts.  The material is about average thickness.  I have some nicer T-Shirts that are a bit thicker, but I've seen thinner material T-shirts too.  The material is softness is about average.  For the price, they're decent thickness and soft enough.  You'd have to spend much more money to get better.", "The Bad: These fit weird.  The sleeves flare out which I've never seen in a T-Shirt before.  Also, the shoulders are too wide; the shoulder line is past my shoulder.  I've never had this problem with any other T-Shirt ever.  The neck is a bit loose.  I was hoping from other reviews that the neck would lay flat.  Though I've seen looser, I can't say these lay flat.", "Got 2 sizes larger than what was needed but they shrunk anyway.", "The fabric on this shirt is very stiff, even after washing. I bought these for undershirts and they're way too thick and stiff to be worn under another shirt. On top of it, the sleeves have huge wings that stick out and look terrible.

In short, these undershirts are very long, making them great to tuck in - and stay tucked in, even after washing and drying (on delicate).

After multiple washes, the sleeves and the width of the shirt shrink.

By the way, it doesn't shrink when washed. As a result, the husband demanded one  size Small. It is yet to come.

This fits me nice in the shoulders and chest, but hangs like a dress around my middle, because there is NO shape or form fitting.  I could live with that.  Wouldn't be the first shirt made for larger people that I have to have tailored to fit me below the chest, but here's the real kicker.  There's something about the design of the sleeves and the weight of the fabric that causes the whole shirt to lift up and bunch around the chest and neck if I lift my arms up shoulder height or higher.  That's definitely something you don't want in a T-Shirt that is supposed to be soft and comfortable.  This cotton is pretty stiff.  Maybe after a few washes it'll be softer, but it seems like a fairly stiff weave.  It certainly doesn't hang/drape like the pictures shown.  Lastly, the pocket, as shown in the picture, wraps around the side of the chest and is largely useless except for keeping a pen in.  It does have a separate little pen spot in the pocket, but the opening is too small to use most modern pens with a rubberized grip.

Then, the sleeves don\u2019t cover up the bicep area well and the tall becomes meaningless.", "  The Pakistani made shirts are the total opposite. They hold their shape and stay true to being tall after many multiple washes and drying. I think the company that owns the Dickie products needs to ditch the Mexican manufacturer and give all their business to Pakistan.

In fact these are the only T-shirts I will buy from here on out. I have bought one in every color both in a short sleeve and long sleeve. What you need to know about the two. The longsleeve ones tend to be a little longer at the hip and the sleeves hang a little long (remember I order tall) it take a little time to shrink up to the proper length.

The problem I have with the shirts is the length - both of the shirt and the sleeves.  The photos show the sleeves well above the elbow and in reality, they fall 2-3 inches lower than what the photo depicts.  The shirt length is also long - it's almost like a 'tall' size 3-4\" longer than most medium sized shirts I own.  The chest and shoulders fit about how a medium should.  I'm going to try a small.  I'm not sure if this is a qa/qc issue or if this style shirt is just a little odd.", "This is just a nice, comfortable shirt to wear. Cotton shirts have the ultimate feel, but I'm sick of them staying soaking wet forever and shrinking a ton when they dry. The blend in this one seems to keep the best of both worlds.

Would definitely buy again and in other colors.", "Everybody knows that Carhartt makes some tough products, and these shirts are no exception. They don't fit exceptionally large, they are a bit long though. If you tuck in your shirt this is of course not a problem. The neck hole isn't very spacious, but it still fits me perfectly. I've worked outside for 8 hour days in the sun and these shirts have held up fine and have kept me cool. Yes, they're expensive shirts, but they're completely worth it in my experience. I have bought 5 of these shirts and they've all fit the same and been of the same quality. I have seen them go on sale a few times, so I would scoop them once they hit the <$15 range, that is a very justifiable price for this product in my opinion.", "Great shirt heavy material & I like the pen pocket inside the main one, be careful not to over cook it in the dryer it's 100% cotton & will shrink but does stretch out after wearing it some I pull mine out of the dryer when it's still damp.", "Fits OK but I wish they offered a 'tall', at 6'5\" the XL is a little short.

Some idiot thought it would be a good idea to put not 1 but 2 tags on the left side of the shirt. Why ?? It started to irritate the hell out of me. I mean in this day & age when everything is going tagless this is the best Carhartt can do ? I love Carhartt they make good clothing but this ruins a very good shirt.

These are about right in terms of size (even though twice my normal size), but fit awkwardly - the back of the shirt keeps sliding down, so that the front of the neck chokes me. I pull the front down again, and it's okay for a few minutes, until the back of the shirt slides down again. I've never had a problem like this with any other shirts. I think these shirts are very poorly designed and incorrectly sized. Like dealing with Amazon, though...", "too small (tight) for Medium, and i have other fruit of the loom t-shirts that i thought were just like this set.

No tags and there's a pocket! Awesome!", "For all the girls that love to wear big t-shirts to sleep... I ordered XL Men to wear to sleep and these almost goes to my knees! So comfortable and the fabric is so soft. Feels like I'm wearing a soft tent. This is my second package. I believe I bought my first set of shirts over a year ago and those shirts are still very soft and comfortable. Cool enough to wear during the summer and warm enough to wear during winter. Comfortable all year round! They've shrunk with time (now they're a bit little higher than the upper half of my thighs) but these are so affordable I wouldn't mind investing in more.", "I order Large and they were all too SMALL, then I ordered EXTRA Large and found out to day one was too small and is marked XL. So do not buy Fruit of the LOOM. I guess the manufacture makes all shirts and stamps whatever size they want it too be. Never will by clothes on AMAZON. I give this product one start because the sizes are not what you get in the package. So one out of four is too small in this last package I brought.", "We end up ordering a package of these every 3-4 months because they're just great t-shirts. I would recommend them. They don't shrink in dryer as I've had them with jeans on high heat and they come out fine. I rinse in white vinegar, not fabric softener, btw, and no wrinkles or pilling. Easy to wash, easy to dry. All around a great t-shirt buy.", "T-shirts were pretty much as expected for the price.  I wanted a very lightweight fabric so these were perfect.  For someone who desires thicker material these may not satisfy them.  The four shirts did not all fit exactly the same way.  There was a slight variation in uniformity of manufacture.", "This was primarily noted with the collar fit.  Colors also do not match those depicted on Amazon.  Be prepared for this.  Fortunately the colors I received were fine.  Two of the shirts were a green-blue color and not the \"earthy\" tones shown.  I am very hard on shirts so I expect these will wear out in rapid order, but for the price they will be cheaply replaced."]},

Just so you know.", "I love the rich color, fit, and style of these; already have 3 other colors of same shirt. Can be worn in or out. And I never dry in dryer but for 10 minutes to get mostly dry, then I hanger the rest. Doing this with all shirts like this minimizes ironing and shrinkage over the life of the piece (dryers kill clothes). I marked \"fits as expected\" but that's only because I now expect all clothing to fit differently than what sizes once indicated. I'm the same weight & measurement as I was 2 decades ago (5-9, 185); however, I now sometimes have to buy extra large rather than just large. Clothes are now made all over the world; that has to create sizing problems.", "After my two original shirts that I bought just before starting my job in finance services were getting so worn out in some places that you could see the light shine right through them if you held it up to a lamp or otherwise, I knew it was time to replace them.  Since I had great satisfaction from Dickies products before, I thought I would give it a try and buy two of these awesome shirts to wear to work.", "In all honesty, I really could not have made a better choice than to get two of these.  Not only do they look good, but they FEEL good as well!  Hunter Green and Navy Blue are two of the best colors for my liking.  Additionally, I can also guess that these will likely last a lot longer than the two shirts I had originally, seeing as these are made with thicker material and are seemingly FAR sturdier.  I will definitely buy more Dickies clothes down the road.", "Candidate for plumbers crack, I own dozens of Dickies work shirts, all had been purchased at Walmart and the price kept getting higher and higher. Found these on Amazon and ordered 3, luckily I only ordered 3 since I am highly disappointed in the quality and fit of these shirts. I wonder if these are bootleg products? The color fades very quickly, I have old Dickies shirts that have more color than these do and these have only been washed maybe a dozen times. The biggest problem I have is the tails of these shirts are shorter than the ones I buy at Walmart, I spend a lot of time bending, stretching and kneeling at work and I am constantly tucking the tail of these shirts back in, they are a good 1 to 2 inches shorter than the Dickies I buy at Walmart. The Walmart shirts rarely have to be tucked back in but with these it is constant and never ending, it is to the point I don't even want to wear these shirts to work, brand new shirts that I will only wear to mow the grass or lounge around the house what a waste of money, I will not be buying more of these shirts from Amazon.", "Carhartt wins hands down. I haven't purchased one of these Dickie's shirts in years and I was somewhat disappointed at the quality of the fabric. The fabric is thinner than I remember and it itches without an undershirt on. The Carhartt shirts on the other hand are a lot thicker and I prefer the way the buttons are placed....with Dickies there is an odd distance between the top button and the next to last button.", " However Dickies has Carhartt beat on colors hands down. I needed a dark brown work shirt and this was the only one available that I liked.", " If you live in a warmer climate these will be fine but don't expect a heavy duty work shirt.

Dressy-ish, without being too formal.  Because it's a durable work shirt, it was a little stiff, but after washing with a lot of fabric softener, it feels much better.", "Excellent shirts, very comfortable, and made very well, but the sizing is pretty far off. I typically fit a 2XL in most brands very well, so that's what I ordered for these. Unfortunately, despite being my normal size, I swim in them. They're absolutely massive. It almost seems like a set of 3x or 4x shirts got the wrong tags. Having said that, I ordered this model shirt two each in three different colors, and the fit for all 6 was identical, so apparently it's just how they're made. They're made well and very comfortable, so I'd definitely recommend them, but make sure you go down a size or two from your normal.", "These are great. Nice, no-tuck, work shirts. No ironing necessary for the most part. Dark ones stay nice through many washes. Even white ones are more stain resistant that most. I don't care for the low, front tag on a no tuck shirt so I use a knife or seam ripper and remove them. The fit is also what I am looking for. I buy a 2X . Typically, shirts tend to run short on me. I find that if a shirt is going to shrink, its is most noticeable in the overall length of the shirt. These shirts don't appear to shrink or draw up in the washer or dryer."]},

After several washings, the color is still consistent and the material thick and comfortable.

Good stuff.", "I get tired of going to the store to buy clothing.  I know Dickies to be a brand that is consistent on their sizes, so there is no risk buying online.  I have also known Dickies to last only slightly less long than Carhartt; but are far more economical to buy.  This is a nice work shirt for me, the color is good, the fit is good and the quality is good.  After working 8 years at my current job, I am coming to the point where my old  Dickies shirts are wearing out, I tend to wear them in the warm months so that's about 50 times warn in a year, for about 9 hours a day -- that is quality.", "I started wearing these shirts a long time ago when I bought them from a local retailer. However, there was a very limited selection in colors. So when I found I could order these online and choose multiple different colors I was excited. The quality of these shirts are superb and are perfect for the type of work that I do. They are very comfortable and are made of a durable quality fabric that can withstand a beating. If you are the technician type and are looking for a shirt that looks good, fits good and can take some punishment on the job, then this shirt is for you. I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone.", "I ordered the shirt, based on reviews, and am quite happy with it. The fit, as others described, is generous. I am an XL whose middle age spread has made most XL shirts uncomfortable around the bay window, but 2XL shirts are baggy and hang off the shoulders. This fits very comfortably and I will soon order a couple more. I intend to wear it for hiking and it's poly cotton blend, light weight, and double breast pockets will make it a comfortable traveler in the Southwest.", "I bought several work shirts in different colors since they were on sale. The dark brown one I received came in plastic packaging without the standard cardboard dickies labels that you typically get with these shirts. I didn't think much of it until I started to inspect the shirt. The brand tag on the back of the neck is different than regular shirts I have purchased. I don't want to make false claims but it doesn't seem like a regular dickies work shirt. Other ones I have purchased show sizing using a letter indicating whether it's small, large or so on. This particular tag uses a numerical size rating. This shirt also came with a missing button hole for the bottom button. On these shirts, there should be a dickies tag on the bottom of the shirt near the last button and this shirt did not have that. I also lined up this shirt alongside the other dickies work shirt to notice any other differences regarding construction. This shirt doesn't seem to line up the same with the stitchings as if the pattern for the material cutouts they used for the individual pattern pieces are different for this particular shirt. I can also notice that the stitching and spacing for the pen hole in the pocket are different than the other ones I have. Overall I am disappointed in this purchase and will probably order directly from dickies next time.", "These are great work shirts but order a size smaller then you usually take. I am 6 foot 215 lbs with a 38 inch waist. Not sure what my chest size is but it is larger then most hahaha. I am a pretty big guy and I take xl in all most all my shirts and coats, but in these shirts I wear a large as an xl fits me like a tent. I have been wearing these shirts for years and they last for a few years in the rotation and look professional at work.", "I have been using Dickie short and long sleeve work shirts for years and will not use any other. They are just the right weight and hold their color fairly well when washed in cold water plus they generally do not require ironing coming out of the drier. I have only ever had one fail when the seam came out under an armpit but the shirt had probably been worn and washed about 60 times by then,", "I wear these everyday.  I'll likely order more soon.", "The fabric is tough and wrinkle resistant, they make me look good on the jobsite.", "I like a shirt with pockets because I need to hear when a call comes in and on some jobs it can get to loud or my pants pocket will become inaccessible.", "These shirts do run large and I had several from years ago so I ordered already knowing that.", "I got this to make my own shirt (to bring joy to others) it runs a bit big but I will keep it", "Really don't have much to add other than that these shirts are actually comfortable enough for casual wear as well. Just an all around solid shirt from dickies that is pretty cheap. I will echo the sentiment that unless you like swimming in your clothes get the smallest size that will fit you comfortably.

Makes me very self conscious to have that much of my neck and shoulders exposed. Too bad, good product otherwise.", "The t-shirts fit very well. We often have a problem for my husband who wears a 4x that the t-shirts we get are too small. These are the right size. He is also disabled and the tightness, especially around the arms, constricts him, so these are his favorites and he seeks them out. The fabric is thick but it's very soft. I will buy some more of these when they become available in different colors. I was hesitant to buy the teal but it's pretty dark and it works well.", "I\u2019m 6\u2019 4\u201d about 275 with relatively broad shoulders and long arms/torso. I bought a 3x tall and I find the fit to be on the roomy side. I like loose fitting t shirts in general so I will keep these but next time will try the 2X Tall.  As an overall statement on sizing they run large compared to other brands that sell 3 XLTs.  I just bought these and have only worn them once but the shirt is comfortable, relatively light but made well (good for Summer here in Florida), and I think a good buy for $10 ( bought 2 pack for $20)."]},

The fit and length are perfect. The cotton is also extremely high quality feeling compared to shirts around the same price point. I\u2019d go so far to say they feel like the premium line of Polo Ralph Lauren T\u2019s (but better fitting).

Lastly, the fit is a \"standard\" fit, not that body hugging \"fitted\" crap that all shirts seem to be nowadays. For us guys with the \"Dad bods\", these shirts hang nicely and hide the guts, jelly rolls and man boobs that we've worked so hard to aquire over the years. I'll be buying plenty more of these shirts in the future! HIGHLY recommended.", "I usually buy white tshirts by Jockey for my husband as undershirts for his dress clothing, which he wears 5 days a week to work. Needless to say, we've used many brands over the years. I decided to try these this time I purchased his white tees based on the reviews and the price. I did go one size up from his usual size (Large) to an XLarge based on a few reviews regarding sizing. They fit perfectly. Not too big anywhere. They're not super tight around the neck like some under shirts can be, which drives my husband nuts. They are very soft right out of the packaging and haven't lost that softness with multiple times through the washer and dryer. I don't use fabric softener. I use wool balls as a natural fabric softener. So no chemical is being used to keep them soft. That's a plus for me because it means it's quality fabric.", "I actually purchased 3 white tshirts by Jockey at the same time I purchased these. I washed them all. Dried them all. Folded them all mixed together and placed them in a stack. I could see the difference. These are a bit thinner than the Jockeys. They aren't quite as white as Jockey. The sizing was nearly exactly the same as a Jockey Large. I wanted to see if my husband noticed a difference. He didn't!", "I've had these a few weeks now. They launder just fine. If there has been shrinkage it's been minimal and not noticeable. They still look brand new. Of course, in time I know they will wear out. All under shirts do when they are used as frequently as my husband must wear them. However, I'm pleased with them. My husband hasn't complained about them and trust me he WOULD complain if the shirts didn't feel right or fit correctly.", "I do think Jockey is a better quality overall, but I would buy these again. I do think they will break down sooner than the Jockey tees due to the thin material they're made of and the fact that these tshirts are worn, waged and dried A LOT. However, I would still recommend them. They are good quality and will last someone else a long time if they aren't been worn almost daily. This is a great deal for two quality white tshirts.", "**I would consider sizing up one size.**", "Finally a basic black tshirt in size medium that is long enough ! At 6' 2\" and 175lbs,  with a 33\" waist and 37\" chest, this tshirt has a few inches of free space in the chest and is fairly snug at the hips, which is fine given most of my other mediums (other brands) are a bit too short on me. Material is soft. Will wrinkle if you dont take it out of dryer asap but thats on me not the shirt. Recommend !", "I like these t shirts quite a bit, enough that I bought eight of them so far. The material is just the right thickness - it's definitely a t shirt, not an undershirt, though it will serve both purposes. I bought the XL and found they fit really well and have held up to multiple washings. Since I'm in a part of the country where t shirt weather can be year-round, these get a lot of wear. My only concern is it seems like the selection has dramatically decreased to the point I'm thinking Amazon has discontinued them. I hope that's not the case as these are quality shirts at a good price.", "The t-shirt is very nice quality. But the size is too big. I brought the medium size and it is more than 4-6 inches bigger than the comparable medium t-shirt from other brands. The medium t-shirt I got was about 44 inches chest size, which is XL as per the sizing chart.", "Already bought 2 sets, so I have 4 of these t-shirts in my closet now.", "Excellent cotton quality, excellent sewing quality.", "Great for wearing in and outdoors.", "Watch out regarding the size selection though, I would order one size below your normal t-shirt size. I ordered Small, and absolutely love the size.", "I am 5'10\", 175lb who usually wear Medium t-shirts in order to enjoy \"the right fit.\"", "To wrap up, I am definitely willing to purchase more and try other colors in the future.", "Next time I will order a large rather than an XL. I'd rather wear a shirt a little too big than one that's too small. I think large would be just right. I love the softness of the cotton, and the color is beautiful. I've never bought a t-shirt of this quality for under $30.", "Review after 1 wash.", "Size Large/Color Blue", "For comparison I\u2019m 215lbs 38\u201d waist.", "Some shrinkage but overall held up very well.  I like the length of the shirt, hangs below the belt.", "On me it reaches the bottom of the fly on my jeans.", "No noticeable color fade.", "I ordered 2 more in red!", "I was skeptical about buying amazon clothes but these are honestly great t shirts. Five stars.", "one wash and stitching unraveled. yes I followed the care instructions. the material feels right, but is extremely light. I doubt i'll trust another AmazonEssentials garment again."]},
{"asin": "B06XWN7P33", "comments": ["I loved this tee. I bought XL's & I couldn't barely get it on. Bought the XXL & it was big when I put it on. I've been a clothing manufacturer for 40 yrs & very familar with cottons. I used domestic cottons and developed my own cottons, yarns & fabrics to use in garment dying. This tee was big to start with & I hoped it would shrink in length, which is usually what happens.  This tee shrunk width & length & I can barely get it on.  It probably shrunk 2 sizes. This is the light blue tee.  The white shrunk a size at least. I love the quality of the tee, but the shrinkage is CRAZY!. I haven't looked at the black or grey yet. The grey I think has a bit of poly in it b/c it's heathered so it shouldn't shrink as bad. I'll post in a day or 2.  FIX THE SHRINK ISSUE! These shouldn't shrink like this. If they do, pls add the allowance for the shrinkage.", "I have always work t-shirts and recently started wearing the Haynes Heavyweight t-shirts. Decided to give these Amazon Essentials a try simply because they are priced a lot lower than the heavyweight t-shirts. After comparing them, I see VERY little difference in size, quality and comfort...not to mention the price difference. Amazon Essentials t-shirts will now be my favorite!! Thank you Amazon!! You now have another happy customer!!", "Wore once and it fit great. Washed it once and it now has a hole in the seam if the neck.", "I ordered these for my picky husband. He loved the Amazon Goidthreads t\u2019s but they were out of stock for quite some time so I ordered these. They are good quality, but lend to typical stretching like Hanes brands always has as well. The product make-up was not quite as good as the good threads. he loves those bc they do not hold a lot of our fur babies hair and are almost a moisture wicking fabric that doesn\u2019t hold deodorant stains. This one does and it seemed to attract it quite a bit even with a lint roller. Decent shirt, but the picky man would likely prefer their goodthreads version better.", "This was a surprise. Most less expensive tee shirts are tight, made of poor fabric, or just generally unappealing to look at. This is the exception. Two for this price is amazing. And they are comfortable shirts. The fabric is reasonably soft (Okay, it's not Egyptian cotton maybe, but it's still comfy). The fit is loose enough even in my regular size (M) to not bind under my arms or other places. It just feels good. What I don't like (Amazon, are you listening?) is the limited colors in the poly-cotton blend fabric. Mine is blue, but only because there are few other colors in this fabric. That fabric is my choice because it helps wick away sweat when I exercise unlike cotton which becomes a damp rag after a short time. Please make the blended fabric in more colors, includiing WHITE.", "These are crap.  At first loved the weight, so much thicker than Haynes.  Were so soft.  After a short time, however, the neck band begin to pull away from the shirt.  This has happened to three now.", "Love them - nothing wrong with them, I think it's a good deal. The size is what XL should be and what most people expect for that size. The material is 100% cotton for this royal blue t-shirt.", "There is nothing wrong with the stitching, nothing to complain about. The color has a nice effect and looks great under a button down shirt.", "I think I will try another color for variety since this purchase went well.", "I usually buy and wear black Hanes t-shirts, since I am a jeans and t-shirts person. I saw Amazon Essentials shirts and decided to give them a try (in black, of course). The shirt was a little big, but not so big that I was swimming in it. The shirt is also long, which is good because I am a tall-ish, curvy person. Best of all, after 2 washes, the shirt has not faded! Usually after a few washes, black shirts fade, but not these! No more light black shirts for me!", "Although the quality, packaging and color are fine. This item (small) is huge. I have never seen a man's shirt this big. I don't know why it was such a poor fit. I ordered the smallest size they have. They do not have any smaller. If you are looking for something to sleep in, this is your choice.", "I am a small man (67\") and it good shape at 140 lbs. This item will never work for me. Perhaps if you are twice my size, the small may fit you. I don't know who could possibly use an XL.", "I think I bought medium, but regardless, the fit is very good. The length is good  - won't come out from your shorts, pants, or kilts. Color is very good as is the quality of the workmanship. I bought these, the heather blue, and purple. Will be buying more since the quality is very good and the price cannot be beat."]},
{"asin": "B00KBZPPZY", "comments": ["Fit on these is just as expected and the material is slightly heavier than the short sleeve version. Had to knock a couple stars off for a bad sew job on the cuffs of two out of the four in the package. The sleeve must not have been straight when the cuff was sewn and it created a permanent \u201ctwist\u201d on the cuff that impossible to remove even with an iron and heavy starch job. Kinda drives me batty enough that I\u2019ll probably end up cutting off the long sleeves. A shame to pay a premium for the long sleeve and have to cut them off.", "The product came in a generic clear bag, well packaged with some sort of product identification label, but not Hanes packaging.", "The product description is for medium weight, the product label says heavy weight.", "The product description is for Comfort Soft, the product label says Comfort Soft, but the cotton is the normal non-soft cotton. I have retail Comfort Soft and these are not that at all.", "The product description at the bottom of the web page has a comparison table, and it shows the heavyweight are no supposed to be Comfort Soft.", "So...it appears this is a knock-off product. Based on other reviews on the cheap quality I did not even try washing, I returned them. I'd rather have the real product.", "As most of the reviews have noted, there is some looseness in the arms. However, the pack I received after the first wash on gentle there was a tear in the right armpit of all four. Bad quality control. The fabric is nice, typical Hanes tshirt. If it weren't for the tears I would have gladly given this product the full five stars.", "In the winter I wear long sleeved T-Shirts with pajama bottoms at night and in the evening and into the next morning with my jeans. These are exactly what I was looking for. They are medium weight, and very comfortable (Hanes T-Shirts are tag-less). And buying these in the 4-pack is a little cheaper than buying them individually. The royal blue is a very nice shade (I like blue) and has shown no tendency to fade.", "Like most Hanes T-shirts these run just slightly small so I order a 3X instead of a 2X.", "The weight is good/heavy. The cut doesn't fit at all like the long sleeve shirts I bought in a department store. The collar is wider, the shoulder width is off by ~1\" on each shoulder, and to describe the material ad \"Comfortsoft\" is laughable. They ride my neck like a t-shirt put on backwards. I have owned dozens of t-shirts by Hanes. These don't measure up, literally or figuratively, to the Hanes brand.", "Good deal for 4 shirts. Using as pajama shirts, so the loose fit is great. I got XL to be sure they would still be comfortable if they shrink.  I have washed a few times and they don't seem to shrink as much as some reviewers experienced. Probably could have gone with a Large as the fit is boxy. If you just want a decent quality plain shirt and you aren't trying to make a fashion statement (using for a work shirt or sleep shirt for example), these are a good buy. The cuff does not fit tight either. Quality is fine for my use; soft and comfortable.", "NOT 100% COTTON. Shirts I received are 90% cotton and 10% polyester.  My husband is allergic to polyester in any amount. Sent back without trying them on.", "I got these shirts to use during summer yard work to keep sun off my arms. I wanted white cotton t-shirt material for it's breathability, and low price so that if a shirt got trashed in the process it wasn't a big deal or I could die it if I really needed to.", "Not much else to it, these are long sleeve white t shirts, so if you like wearing white t shirts, just imagine the sleeves being extended and there you have it! White is also good for summer yard work since it reflects the sun light. They also do okay and blocking the thorns and branches although it isn't the most durable material. I feel certain I will get more than my moneys worth from these as I tend to keep my white t shirts for many years until they practically disintegrate.", "Though I wish that they were additionally offered as a combination of colors in one package I am very happy with this purchase. This is very durable material and much thicker than a standard t-shirt. I normally don't wear a snug t-shirt but I like the feel of this cotton. I absolutely recommend that you get a size larger if you don't like a tapered feel because they do shrink a bit when you wash them and naturally I suggest you doing that first BEFORE you wear them.", "The neck is insanely squiggly. They are also VERY short shirts. I am just 5 feet 6 inches tall and the medium shirts were way too short, lifting my hands a tiny bit reveals my belly button. These shirts SUCK. I recommend Fruit of the Loom, they don't have trash neck."]},
{"asin": "B00KBZPPZY", "comments": ["Do not buy. I never write product reviews, but these \"Hanes\" shirts are perhaps the most disappointing thing I've bought on Amazon. They shrunk from a mediun to a small even when left to air dry. Upon drying the first time, the stitching on the sleeves and waist came undone, further exacerbating the shrinkage and ruining the fit of the shirts. Save yourself time and effort and buy legitimate Hanes shirts at a retailer.", "I believe, as other reviewers have stated, that this is a counterfeit product. The cotton material (if that's what it is) feels stiff, starchy and itchy. The shirts do not come in Hanes packaging, but a clear plastic bag. The label looks suspiciously like an iron on and has nearly dissolved after 4 washings. Also, the shirts are just as itchy and stiff after 4 washings. Do not buy from this company! I contacted them about my issue and they stated they will not replace or issue a refund after washing. The only reason I washed them was because I thought the stiffness would come out.", "Fit is great except the opening for the arms is almost twice the size it needs to be. I bought XL and the length and chest and arm length are perfect (5'10\" 225 lots of push ups). But if you wear it under a t shirt it looks wierd as the shoulder holes where the sleeves start are twice the size of my arms...that aren't Arnold big but bigger than some. Only complaint though.", "They are size XL but fit more like a large. I am 6 feet 4 inches tall and the sleeve length is long enough but not too wide. I wear these underneath both t-shirts and polo shirts in colder weather so they are perfect for me. I don't like wearing long sleeve shirts with logos underneath polo shirts as sometimes the logo can show through and that looks bad. They are tag free which is nice. No worries about that annoying tag itching you. The price is excellent too. I don't know about quality since I haven't had them long enough to know.", "Hubs works in a medical environment and has to wear scrubs.  Scrubs are thin and not very insulating.  It's kind of cold where he works so he asked me to get him some long-sleeve T-shirts to wear underneath his scrub top and he says they really help to keep him warm.  They wash and dry just fine with no shrinkage or fading.  I got him the XL size and they are just a tad too big but at least they aren't binding in any way.  Good medium weight material and quality construction.", "I bought 2 of the 4 packs of the long sleeved white t-shirts and within 6 months every single one of them had developed at least one hole under the arms. Mending did not save them as they developed a hole somewhere else. There was either a split along the seam or a hole in the material. Very poor quality.", "i got an x large.  the sleeves fit well to my arms, but the shirt itself just goes to my waist.  I was hoping it would go down further, but no.  this is very thick.  comfort soft?  it feels very thick.  it is not an undershirt to wear, its more of a long sleeve shirt to wear.  I thought it would be thinner, like an undershirt, but no its not.  the 4 pack feels very heavy. its a heavy shirt, what more can I say?", "I ordered other FotL undershirts, feel great, like them. This long sleeve black large however was UNWEARABLE. Tight neck that feels like SANDPAPER. Wrists elastics that also are ROUGH feeling. Overall shirt material feels ROUGH. Returned and now what may be the first 1-star review Iv'e ever written on Amazon in 20 years.", "Great fit - I'm 6'2\", fairly fit and depending on the manufacturer I need either an XL or Large.  Most XL's are a bit baggy on me and Large's are sometimes too short in length and sleeves.  I ordered a Large and it fits perfect.  I have enough length to tuck it in and have it stay tucked in, and the sleeves are perfect length.", "When I opened the package there was a rather strong unpleasant odor ...  I inspected the shirts and laundered them ...", "After washing, they smelled nice and fit perfectly.  The material is soft and feels good against the skin.  Just what I wanted."]}
