I packed up my protein shaker, three 16oz water bottles, a small backpack, gloves, towel, diapers/wipes/snacks for my kids among other necessities and could still fit maybe 20% more. I posted pics wearing the bag so you can see how large the \u201csmall\u201d size is. It\u2019s lightweight but feels well made, and the material feels like it should be easy to clean. I am so happy with this bag!", "Ok so I was trying to find a bag that worked for my 12 year old for volleyball. She had a book bag for school and wanted something small enough she could fit in her locker with her book bag. The small seemed like it might be too big. They are small lockers... and they can\u2019t carry bags at school. I wanted so bad to see reviews of the extra small but I couldn\u2019t find them so I took a chance and I\u2019m glad I did. I can fit her volleyball shoes in the side pockets still, her uniform, water bottle, inhaler, and a volleyball in her bag. Everything she needs fits great. Hopefully this helps if anyone is wondering what I was...is it \u201ctoo\u201d small... nope!", "I wanted something I could use for a weekend worth of clothes and still be carried onto an airline. This is a good size. I was really torn between the medium and small. After checking the medium in person at a local store it's way too big compared to this.

Can't wait to load it up with stuff and see how it holds.", "i love the fit, i wore this to work as a dress shirt, i'm a female 180 lbs and a small fits just right", "This is huge disapointment. The bag looks good, but poorly designed.I bought small size, the ad video said it's a shoe compartment and it appears to be a shoe compartment too. I have man shoe size 10, and it doesn't fit that I cannot zip the compartment.While my other bag which is much smaller than this one can store the same shoe easily in its shoe compartment (see photos)If you want a nice looking bag, this bag is an option. But if you want a funtional compact bag with usable shoe compartment, DON'T BUY THE SMALL SIZE (not sure about the larger size)", "So I ordered a medium size. Upon arrival I enthusiastically opened the package and inspected my new gym bag. I'm pretty sure I ordered brand new, either that or I missed the fine print where it said \"complementary women's hair scrunchie inside\" hence the 4 star rating. My wife and I laughed but I'm disappointed. I paid for brand new and got a used bag.

Bag is very roomy and I feel it could be used for any age. The vented shoe compartment is a huge plus for an athlete.We love how the bright colors pop against the black, it is a very attractive bag.Could be used for multiple sports or a sleepover bag for travel.Definitely would purchase another bag like this!Very nice quality.", "I\u2019ve had my old UA bag for going on ten years. It\u2019s old but still holding together. I ordered a new one, cheaper material, no rubber pads on bottom, cheaper zipper, thin fabric. No reinforcements in the straps, just sewn into the seam.  I carry my chains for doing weighted dips in my bag and other items.  I don\u2019t think this would last 2 months. It\u2019s going back.", "I love my gym bag! Prior to writing the review, I legitimately tried to think of any cons to share with you all about the bag. I have nothing! The only thing that I would tell you is to be aware that this is a LARGE bag. Meaning, if you are of average height, it may look a little odd on you. You may have to play with the straps a bit to get it how you want it. Personally, I could care less about that.I literally store everything I need for the gym into this bag: my \"under clothes\", shirt, pants, shoes, bag to keep my dirty clothes in, shower towel, workout towel, earbuds, Kindle, shaker cup, and shake mix. Even after I have all that in the bag, there is still a bunch more space left that is left unused.So, if you need a high quality bag to put all your stuff in, this is it!"]},

One star subtracted as one of the shirts has already started to have its stitching come loose at the waist, but at this price point and the continued integrity of the clothing I can handle some stray threads.These coupled with moisture-wicking boxers have completely revolutionized my summers here in the south.", "I read the other reviews prior to ordering this shirt and saw that they run small. I normally would wear a 3XLT, in this case I bought a 4XLT. It fits me just right. Glad I went big. I am happy with this purchase. I have washed this shirt several times and I have not noticed any shrinkage or any problems with the stitching. My only complaint with the shirt was the tag, it was a little itchy, but that was easily fixed by cutting it off. I am 6' and 340lbs. I have a 54\" waist and this shirt covers everything when I raise both arms. That's what I was looking for. A work shirt that will keep me cool while keeping the fat covered up.", "My husband is SO picky when it comes to shirts, and any clothes really. He's about 6 feet tall, and build very broad. He also team ropes on horses. So he likes to wear shirts that will stay tucked in while he is riding down the arena and swinging his rope.He also has very large arms, so that is usually hard to find shirts that fit in that area as well.He absolutely loves these shirts. Especially for now in the summertime when it's so hot out!They are so soft and silky and fit around his arms and stay tucked in. I get him the xlarge tall so that it is longer. We have the navy, maroon, and grey so far and I am sure I will end up ordering more. They are very breezy and made well. He is hard on his clothes, working outside with animals all the time, and these shirts have held up very well. They are not sure tight on him, and not super loose. They fit just right. He normally wears an xlarge in shirts, so this is true to size.", "I have a few athletic shirts like this.  They all dry quickly; hence, the \"Dri\" brand name. But keep in mind that none leave you feeling like you haven't sweat.  Don't expect a dry shirt after the workout - if you put in the work, you will get these soaked.  With that said I love the feel, how it hangs (never grabs the skin, even when wet), and the light weight.  I regularly choose these style shirts over cotton.  I wear them alone - no undershirt.  I've chosen this brand twice, and the big/tall 2xl (I'm 6'4\", 260lbs, 3-5-mile runner most days) covers nicely whether I'm working abs, running or raising weights above my head - I never have to worry about the shirt being too short.  Wash on cold, dry on low or let hang dry (will hang dry in 4 hours).  I never machine-dry completely.  They stand up nicely to wrinkles, so fold and place a few in your gym bag.  They'll save some bag space, and they look good.", "- Size runs small. I'm a 3XLT, 6'4 325 pounds.

I tend to sweat like I stole something most of the time, and wearing a cotton undershirt in the office meant I spent most of the day in a damp shirt. This shirt, however, wicks very well and allows me to cool off quickly. Great product - I've since bought ten of them for everyday wear.", "No brand shirt came balled up in a plastic bag.  Very thin, silk like material.  I had my doubts.  I have to say, though, that this shirt is now my favorite workout shirt.  It's very light, cool, and covers my gut through all types of exercises in the gym.  I'm 6'0 215 and this shirt gives me about 4-5 inches below the waist and also plenty of length in the sleeves.  The Large was not too loose and not too tight - just right to feel good but show off the guns :)  I think for a shirt with no major label / brand, it should be a few bucks cheaper, but I will buy more.  I'm spoiled with the lightweight feel.  Let's hope other colors are consistent with sizing.", "Great t-shirt/undershirt. Unlike cotton these dry quickly both right out of the wash, hung up (they never go in the dryer) and when worn and you are sweating. I got the tall version so they stay tucked in, and they do. Even if you've been moving around these stay nicely. Yes, I've seen a few stray threads and and had to have a small section of hem resewn on one, otherwise no issues. The white ones I've owned for over a year have remained white and look crisp and clean showing at the neck of a dress shirt, nor have the collars lost shape.If anything could be improved it would be the way this material holds odor especially after one wearing on hot days. But I think that is a normal characteristic of poly. These are perfect for travel too, as said before, they wash and air dry fast.", "Bought large/tall and these are truly TALL, which is exactly what I wanted.  I\u2019m 6\u20191 and 175, and these are plenty long enough so you don\u2019t have to \u201cworry\u201d when bending over.  Also, if you forgot to fold/hang them and they are left in the dryer, they don\u2019t wrinkle the way ordinary shirts would.  It\u2019s a very forgiving shirt, a very lightweight shirt, a very comfortable shirt, a very cool looking shirt, and a very very long shirt (L/T).  5+Stars for something that is otherwise very difficult to find.", "The sizing on these shirts seems way off. We ordered a shirt in a size LARGER than my husband would normally wear and when the shirt arrived it was still too small and tight (both length and width). It was certainly pink enough though and we gave it to my father-in-law who is smaller than my husband and it fit him perfectly. But it's nuts that this shirt is sized at least two sizes off of what it should be."]},
{"asin": "B075ZZF47B", "comments": ["I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8\" and 140\", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked as well.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer. Also, I think that the Gilden shrank significantly in the first wash. The shrinkage seemed to be in t in the shoulders and in the length. I would say that the T-shirt went from a large to a medium. It still fits but I had wanted a large T-shirt, not a medium.  I washed the T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.", "My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.", "I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.", "Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.A great find!", "These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.", "These are my husband's favorite shirts, they are thick and durable. We will be buying more.", "Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like. I am a throw it in the laundry and go type so I needed bigger so I could shrink it. I am 250 lbs and 5'11 with a beer gut. I got the 2x and it fit just a touch too big and after 1 wash it is perfect. After a few more washes I might have wished on a 3x but not sure yet. As of now they are perfect and am happy. Only thing that will change when I order more is color and  possible size upgrade if it continues to shrink.", "Size was correct. Shirt is soft and comfortable as you would expect of cotton. I will be buying more of these.", "Very disappointed with these T's. After the first washing the bottom hems unraveled. Also the material is super scratchy.

Would be curious to know if anybody else has had the same situation.", "They use the words \"Soft premium cotton\", but I don't think Gildan knows what soft is.

There's also another brightly colored Champion emblem on the side of the sleeve for this shirt.

I think the instructions are just wash/dry, but I want these to stay new looking. Quality shirts.", "I bought this shirt to use as part of a Halloween costume and didn't really plan on wearing it after that. After trying it on and realizing how comfortable the shirt was, I think it's going to find it's way into my regular rotation (I know I stole this line from the Simpsons, but it applies). The fabric feels great, and the bright red really does pop. The sleeves are a good length for me, something which is not always the case with shirts since i have long arms. I purchased a size larger than normal half-expecting the shirt to run small, but this was not the case. It fits exactly as I'd hoped a shirt of the size up would, which is great for me really since I prefer baggier clothes to tighter. I am very happy with this shirt, the price was right, and it's exactly what I was looking for.", "I needed lightweight long sleeve large roomy shirts for hiking (long enough to cover my behind) and these do the trick well enough. I thought I wanted cotton, but the 50/50 blend and the light weight really works much better than my heavy cotton shirts which just get heavy with sweat as opposed to these shirts which are light enough to dry as I hike.My one gripe is that of the 4 shirts I bought, THREE of them sprung a hole in the same place - the seam on the arm right by the cuff. The seam came open and on one of the unraveled so that the whole cuff came off. I put a few stitches on the seam near the cuff on the others and they've been fine.", "The shirt was delivered promptly with no defects. Personally I am looking for a work shirt. This shirt seams light weight and a bit on the stretchy side. Cotton blend might be a little excessive for my purposes. The only thing I didn't really like about the shirt is that the length is a bit short. the fact that it's a little more slippery than a cotton shirt makes it fairly likely that it's. It going to stay in my belt through a work day. So at least in my case it's not really a great work shirt but lesson learned. If you need it for another reason especially if you need good ventilation and movement with a comfortable feel on your skin this is a good value for the money.", "I've been buying a lot of long sleeve shirts lately to replace old ones.  I've tried a few different brands and this is one of my favorites.  I did buy XXL even though I'm typically an XL.  I've found recently that XL is more like a Large, so I'm buying XXL first now.  This fits me perfectly.  I'm 6' 2\", 210lbs.", "This shirt is my preferred style: crew (normal) collar, long sleeves, no pocket - extremely simple. It's also quite inexpensive. The length  - referring to the shirt body, not the sleeves - is long, which I also like, and I couldn't tell what the length would be until it arrived and I tried it on. I would have preferred there to be a bit more room in the midsection area; if you have a big gut, it might be a little tight around the middle. I haven't washed it yet to see how it does, but with 50% cotton and 50% polyester, I don't expect any shrinking to occur. The material is light-weight. I ordered size XL, and that was the right choice for this model. I also liked the packaging, which is minimal to the extreme."]}
