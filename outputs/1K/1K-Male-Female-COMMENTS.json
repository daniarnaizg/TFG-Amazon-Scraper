The large fits my 6'1\" frame correctly.My minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.For the price, these are a fantastic buy.", "bad! bad! bad! Very bad quality under-shirts with extremely thin material. All shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere. Never again any product from Gildan!", "You are looking at these because you want some white t-shirts but want the cheapest set you can find. These shirts are \"good enough\" for an undershirtz provided that you don't care if they shrink after one wash. If you just wear them under your work shirt and take them off when you get home, these are perfect. If you want to wear these as a shirt by itself, I'm not so sure this is the best option. Maybe I just shouldn't have put this in the dryer but then again other shirts I've done this with haven't shrunk so much.", "So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting  or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.", "The shirts are comfortable, but the quality control is bad.  One of the shirts had a little white sticker with a red arrow that pointed to a hole in the shirt. Clearly the QC department marked that as a defective shirt, but it was still included in the package even though it was marked as defective.A couple weeks ago I had bought a pack of the same Gildan shirts at Target and one of the shirts had a 1\" diameter hole in it, so apparently this is an ongoing problem with quality control.", "Good price for a 6pack of undershirts. Im 6'3, on the lean side, with a basketball in front.A top notch high end Tshirt, I can get by with a true American large.I ordered an XL on these, expecting a good bit of shrink, like I do other bulk pack T's.The XL fits me absolutely perfect out of pack. Not skin tight, but not a moo moo either.Length out of pack is to my fingertips, arms held down,  like a good sport coat length.Hands up, length covers my belt buckle out of pack.Cheap XL = high end L.After one wash/dry, these drew up about 2 inches, shrank about 1/2-1\" over all girth.The fit actually got better, neck is great, but the length is kinda pushing it for moving around, and bending over etc.It will come un tucked under my work shirt. But so does every other cheap bulk pack non-tall shirt.I really probably should've went with a tall size, but these will do fine for an undershirt.Nice summer weight.", "2nd time ordering these, these are solid shirts. I mean not sure what some people expect from these after reading the reviews. I ordered the 2x which fit me nicely. I wear these mostly for undershirts and they are just fine. SO if you are looking for some inexpensive shirts, might as well buy these lol", "Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts are very comfortable very well made and I would highly recommend them I wear a lot of white shirts and comfort bility and the style and fabric of the shirt is very important to me I  Used to always  Hans but they've got to be very expensive and I don't mind the price but the quality has also been reduced but Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts  Suppress my expectations and if I could give them a 10 star I would I would highly recommend", "Good value for well-made T-shirts. These shirts are all I will buy now. Material is excellent and they do not shrink much.", "The shirts say they are 100% Cotten but I don\u2019t believe I have ever felt such rough scratchy cotton. I have had these shirts for a few weeks now and they have been washed multiple times and are still scratchy. I also put one on this morning and it has a hole in the arm pit. I would not suggest buying these and I will not buy them again."]},
{"asin": "B0000ANHT7", "comments": ["This is the best shirt out of several brands of work shirts I have tried. I tried stocking up on Duluth Trading Long-Tail t-shirts because they had extra room called a 'tradesman fit' that's the opposite of a slim-fit shirt, that and they are a few inches longer on the bottom to prevent plumber's crack. The problem I ran into, price. Duluth Trading stuff is really nice, I mean REALLY NICE, but it's too expensive. From underwear to shirts to pants, I love their stuff to death but I went broke just buying 2-3 days worth of clothing.So began my search for alternatives. For a few days I wrapped my mind around all normal shirts being too short for me. One, I do not like plumbers crack and I bend down and kneel down a lot. Two, I conceal carry. Long shirts do 80-90% of the concealment for you if you have one, otherwise you have to dig a holster inside your pants and dig into your hip hard. Extra-tall sized shirts is a cheap alternative to the semi-custom size of the Duluth Longtail t-shirts. Next criteria I needed, price. Well pretty much everything is cheaper than Duluth, except maybe UnderArmour. But UnderArmour stuff is generally tight-fitting, so they lose that competition. These are shirts I bought in Tall size to supplement my existing longer Longtail t-shirts:Fruit-of-the-Loom (FOTL) cotton t-shirt from Wal-Mart: Average fit around my body, feels like advertized size. Thin material. Cost $8 in Wal-Mart, cheap but it's not a quality shirt at all and doesn't compete with the rest. It's just a grade lower. It's a cheap shirt but I would still gladly wear this if I didn't have my other work-shirts.Hane's Beefy-T's 6.10z t-shirt: Cheap, less than half price of Duluth. Material is too thin for me for a work-shirt. Yes, even in summer I like thick material as it wicks more sweat away. The material was too thin for a work shirt, same thickness as the FOTL shirt. Slightly trim fitting, after break-in they are what I consider 'normal' for their advertised size, slightly more trim than the FOTL. $10 with Prime.Dickie's Big-tall heavyweight crew neck short-sleeve: thicker than the Beefy-T, but just barely. Same price as Beefy-T. Very trim fitting for advertised size, I would consider these as a 'trim fit' for very lean individuals to be comfortable in. Even if I was in the same shape as I was at 21, these would still be tight fitting.Duluth Long-Tail t-shirt (did not order as tall, ordered at normal height): Thick material, comfortable in summer by wicking moisture better and comfortable in winter since it's thicker. Two or three inches taller than other standard-sized shirts which spoiled me and now I order tall shirts from all other companies. I consider them nearly perfect shirts year-round but the price, I only have 3 because after shipping they run over $20 a piece from Duluth, and no Duluth does not have Amazon Prime shipping. Nice, very nice, but expensive to build a wardrobe with.Carhartt Big-Tall Work Wear Short-Sleeve t-shirt: Material is as thick as Duluth shirt. I ordered this in tall, and is 1 inch longer than the standard-length Longtail-T from Duluth as a result. Not quite as generous fitting as the Duluth shirt, but it's a good bit larger girth than the other brand shirts. Material is slightly rougher feeling than the Duluth but still comfortable even when bending non-stop. Costs $15 with Amazon Prime, 50% more than the Hane's and Dickie's but at least $5 cheaper than a Duluth shirt.My summary is the Carhartt wins overall. Thick enough, long enough, and I tested mine in 100 degree heat recently. Like the Duluth shirt, the thicker material worked to help wick sweat away longer than thinner shirts will. But I live in a very humid area a few miles from the Mississippi river. Very humid Mid-Spring to Fall. Lots of people might not need to fight humidity this much. I can stock 4 Carhartt shirts for a buck or two cheaper than 3 Duluth shirts, and anyone who works outside often knows you can often go through two shirts or maybe even three on a hot work-day in order to keep dry. So that means I can stock up on 12 shirts instead of 9 going Carhartt to carry me through a whole week without running out of shirts, even when a certain family member (you know who you are in each family) hides them in a clothes pile somewhere for a few days. The savings is enough to make a big difference for anyone buying a few shirts.", "Once again, not disappointed with the Carhartt shirts I purchased to be embroidered for our construction business. Hunter Green pictured on top of Carbon Heather, Dark Cobalt Blue, and then the navy, all Carhartt brand and original fit. Size LARGE men's and the size is 24 inches under the arm and 32 inches long- from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the shirt. Also bought some size large Guilden brand shirts, and the Carhartt is an inch wider, longer, and the arms are way wider as well. Great quality and I know from past purchases that they hold up with heavy use and heavy washing.", "As you can see from the label this shirt made in Guatemala is NOT 100% cotton, nor is the color anywhere as light as the heather grey. You sent me Desert grey. The other two made in Haiti and Mexico supposedly were, but all feel pretty rough like polyester!", "TERRIBLE QUALITY SIZING CONTROL I have purchased these numerous times I re-READ the TAGLESS TAG in the shirt SHOCKER it's clearly Stamped 3 X LARGE TALL. it was 7\" longer &amp; at least 6\" inches WIDER than the old ones I have made in GUATEMALA (these were also stamped exactly the same &amp; made in Guatemala if you happen to weigh 300-500 pounds and are 6' 8\"+ these will probably Fit YOU.SIDENOTE=I am 6' 4\" 260#  58\"chest  &amp; my regular size is 3XLT in this Carhartt workwear Pocket T.the shirt is a nice heavy weight so I am hoping if I order 2XL they will fit like the 3XLT used to Thank Goodness for PRIME &amp;  Free Returns", "Normally I wear a size large T shirt so I ordered the large. It was a little too big so I ordered a Medium. When the Medium arrived it was exactly the same size as the large, so I ordered a Small. When the Small came it was exactly the same size as the Medium and the Large. There is only one size they are just marked with S.M.L. Since I only use these for working in the yard it's not a big deal, but all of them are the same size.", "Great shirts and its about all I wear. I liked the light duty shirt but it lagged a little too much with all the junk I carry so these are it. Summer and long sleeves in the fall and winter. I've been a customer since I was a kid. The offshore waters here in the northeast are unforgiving most of the time so I wear their stuff on  the outside too. On these,no ripped off pockets or torn armpits,they wash well and you can't beat them for comfort. I've got cigar burn holes in them and the holes don't stretch out. The little burnholes are still little burn holes when they com out of the wash,good stuff and this is a great deal.", "Love these shirts. They wash up well, don't shrink, the neck stays tight. Sure, they are pricier than other tshirts, but well worth the extra money. Others will be long relegated to the rag bag or sleep shirts for your family and these will still be going strong. Bite the bullet and order a few. You won't regret it.I ordered several of these and the Dickies. Very close. These were cut about an inch longer. Other than that, they were virtually identical. The length made the difference for me. Dickies went back and I ordered more Carhartts.But, be advised, they are a heavier material than most. Too heavy to be worn as an undershirt.", "My husband is 6' 3\" and 300+ lbs. He requires a shirt with a pocket, a long torso to tuck in and one that doesn't stretch out or lose it's shape. He is very happy with these shirts. He isn't a fan of advertising a brand name but is impressed with the quality.", "Based on reviews,was a bit concerned about everything, but have had great experience with Carhartt. I ordered two like colored shirts and they looked a bit large when I got them, but after a normal wash and dry they reduced size to large which was my hope. Feel and look great. Comfortable. Cannot speak on garments from different countries and size difference. These were made in Mexico.", "These shirts are made well, meaning they are stitched neatly and are constructed out of quality knit.  The shirts come in a variety of colors, from subdued heathers to brighter classic hues.  They wash and dry without wrinkles and we use laundromats, so that says a lot. This is the second order we have placed for these Tee Shirts and I suspect we will order more in the future. The fit was perfect for my husband who is a big guy.  Use as work shirts that will outlast others or wear everyday for all kinds of activities."]},

There you happy? I put on a few pounds in the belly region and needed shirts that would cover up my gut. I hate standing there feeling a cool breeze on my stomach only to realize it's because my fat is sticking out. These shirts do the trick. Sure I'm still fat but at least these shirts help cover the skin up so I don't scare random people sending them screaming and crying only to be traumatized for the rest of their lives.Update: I just ordered for the third time.", "This is one issue I've had with the few clothing purchases I've made on line... so often what you see is NOT what you get, which is why I don't often resort to it. I ordered the \"assorted earth tones\" 4 pack, and when you click on the assorted earth tones, what's shown are shirts that look like a steel blue, a brown, an olive green, and I guess what they're calling a \"heather grey\". The description says that they're all 100% cotton, with the exception of the heather grey, which is 90% cotton, 10% polyester. Well, the most important part of the product description is the part that says \"colors may vary\" - you ain't kiddin'!What I ended up getting were two of the EXACT SAME same grayish-blue shirts (90% cotton, 10% polyester) rather than steel blue, a much lighter shade of brown than shown (90% cotton, 10% polyester), and a teal shirt rather than the olive (the ONLY one that's 100% cotton!)These are for my hard-working, blue collar hubby, and he's not really going to care what the colors are - he's always been completely satisfied with the Fruit of the Loom pocket tees I've purchased in the past (he's a big guy, we buy the 3XL size, he likes the way they fit him), and it's nice that they're all tag-less now. But the shirts in this pack are made in El Salvador, and here's what the washing instructions say: \"Para Mexico Lavar Con Detergente/No Exprimir\". My high school Spanish class was a lifetime ago!

But something has changed and these do not fit like the last ones we bought in the store.  They run small and too long.PROS:  They are soft and don't get twisted when washed.  There is some minimal pilling after multiple wears (like six months of every day wear) but that is to be expected.  Price is great as you get 4 shirts for the price and one shirt in the stores costs $6.CONS:  Size is off.  My son wears a XL and fits XL in other FOL shirts. These ones are way too tight and too long for him.  He said they feel like he's wearing a tube sock as a top. Also, going by the picture we expected two darker grey and two blue but received 3 blue (light blue, darker deep blue, and a grayish blue) and a light grey shirt.", "With this product you get 4 crew neck t-shirts at an inexpensive price.These undershirts are made of cotton which makes them soft and comfortable.The branding and sizing information is stamped on the back of the inside of these shirts, which is great because there are no tags to cause irritation and itching.These undershirts are fairly thin and lightweight, so if you are doing some heavy construction work (or yard work, or etc.) they aren't the most durable.It must be noted that these undershirts will shrink after a couple washes, which could mean trouble for people who wear these tighter to begin with or have long torsos.I purchased these undershirts to wear under my polo shirts at work.  They fit well and I am still able to tuck them into my pants (even after shrinking in the wash), so I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend that you purchase these undershirts if you have similar needs.-In Short-Pros:InexpensiveComfortableAssorted colorsCons:Will shrink after a few washesNot the most durable*Please click \"Yes\" if you found this review helpful.

He works outdoors, at a ranch, and like pockets on his t-shirts to carry a note pad for easy access. So these t-shirts fit all his needs at a reasonable price ($14.00 for a 5-pack in April 2019).I noticed other people reviewing said they shrunk. Well, duh. ALL t-shirts shrink if you put them in the dyer. For that matter, everything shrinks if dried long enough.  We don't do that. Just hang the freshly washed t-shirt on a plastic hanger, pull the wrinkles out while it's wet, and they won't shrink. Problem solved. They'll last longer, too. (Hint: You can do the same thing with jeans, etc. Towels line dried (or hung in the bathroom if you live in an apt or it's raining) are a little stiff when first dried but fluff out fine as soon as they hit your damp skin. To hang items like jeans and slacks, save &amp; reuse the plastic snap hangers that come with new clothing.  Line drying saves money, prolongs the life of the material  and works almost as well as if you had actually IRONED your clothing if done right.)", "I'm a small, but all smalls were sold out...

I'd ordered them in Large, except that after I took them out of the drier, these suckers had shrunk down to a Medium. And I am not a Medium. Another quibble is that, now, any time I raise my arm, the sleeves - that were too short in the first place - ride up and bunch up around the armpits, so that I have to pick at them and tug them out. I can't even wave at people any more. My friends think I'd gotten snooty. I would execute a crestfallen face palm, but the sleeves'll just ride up again.

We hope this information is helpful and you enjoy the shirt.Please let us know if you require additional information.Best regards,NickVapor Apparel\u201dI\u2019m rating this shirt 5 stars because:1- Most purchasers give it rave reviews and,2- The honesty of Nick\u2019s response.Though I did like the looks, feel and price of the shirt it just isn\u2019t able to give me the UV protection I need.", "I really like the material of the Vapor but I read the reviews for sizing and was thrown off (my mistake).  I'm 5'11\" and 199 and ordered the Medium at some reviewers comments.  As it turns out, the Large would have been a better call.", "Vapor Apparel makes a very good performance shirt for men - I needed protection from the sun due to numerous skin cancers over the past few years and my Derm Doctor recommended going with shirts having high UPF protection - although Vapor's price point is half of what a HUK shirt would cost if you're really budget restricted but need the protection you probably should look at Hanes Cool Dri long sleeve shirts which are about half the cost of Vapor's shirts - I purchased both and both work well for their intended purpose! As far as the size I found that I could have used a size Large with either brand but they fit me close (maybe not snug) across the chest so I ordered X-Large which fits up top much better to my taste but you have to put up with a longer length in the shirt - if you tuck it in that issue doesn't come into play but if you leave it out then you may want to stay with a Large.", "################################################5.17.19:Just ordered 3 more, 1 white &amp; 2 black.I'll more than likely purchase several more so I have one for every day of week ( min ) of 7, plus a  couple more so when I use two in one day.Working out pretty hard so I don't want to get all the same size in case I trim down and need smaller size...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE SHIRTS.Durable &amp; Extremely comfortable for regular everyday use and Exceptionally comfortable when cycling or performing any activity where one perspires or sweats alot as they wick wetness away from body and shirt stays dry...Love these shirts and they fit my body very very good...################################################Update 5.15.16:Wore it after being washed and hung dry for first time.  It has shrunk at all.  Did a 33 mile bike ride on a very warm day and felt comfortable the whole time.No sunburns, not wet, not cold, no additional wet like cotton after it gets wet.I'm going to get 3 or 4 more...################################################Update 5.9.16:Wore shirt for the first time and it performed as advertised.  Felt great, comfortable and definitely wicks away sweat and keeps one feeling drying and comfortable, plus as advertised, unlike cotton that get's heavier as it gets wet, this shirt is very, very light.I washed it, but haven't tried it on since, so  I don't know if it has shrunk any.  I'll update once I've had chance to wear it again.If it hasn't shrunk, then I'll purchase a minimum of 2 more for a total of 3 and probably even more for every day use / riding...The shirt really feels comfortable and good against the skin.################################################Original Review:I was anxiously and eagerly waiting for this item after reading all the great reviews...I just received it and put it on.Feel great, looks great, fits great...I have long arms and sleeves fit perfect...  ( cover wrists and go all the way to base of palms ).I've been lifting weights and it fits neck, shoulders, chest and arms great...It's loose fitting but not baggy or tight...Length is about 10 inches below my waist or even with private parts...I really love look and feel.Just hope it's durable after washing and won't shrink as I'll wash in cold water and hang dry... Hope it'll wick persperation and sweat away and stay dry like it says plus provide UV protection...If product does at it says I'll buy 3 or 4 more...", "This shirt exceeds my expectations.  I bought it to wear while playing golf and I live in south FL, where the sun is very bright, very hot between 11 am and 3 pm, and not much breeze.  I wear the shirt under a short sleeve golf shirt (collared shirt required) and it is very comfortable--doesn't restrict my swing at all  and keeps my arms and neck from the sun for 4+ hours.  The sleeves are long enough to cover my arms just over th wrists (35\").  Needless to say I have washed it after play (4 times per wk) and it holds the size and shape very well.  Best recommendation of all, ordering three more so I'm not having to wash one every night for the next day's golf. A great alternative to 50 SPF on your arms twice a round.", "This is NOT full cut. The fabric is clingy too. Returned item. For outdoor use prefer loose fitting and for the fabric not to stick to the skin. As a body shirt in the gym it is ok and more like body armour products. Description is not accurate.", "My dermatologist strongly recommended that I start wearing UPF shirts(lots of skin cancers). I was given a catalog and the prices were sky high and beyond my budget but I came here to Amazon and found this shirt. It fits well, looks good and was more than 1/2 off the catalog merchandise. I will definitely be buying more.", "Great shirt...but it smells weird! I'm not sure if it's the material, the built in sun protection, or something else, but when I received the item (clearly new with tags in a plastic bag), it smelled as if someone had worn it before I got it while taking a brisk walk. It didn't smell disgusting, but it was noticeably musky. I even washed the shirt before wearing it and the smell never went away. That being said, I've worn the shirt several times since I got it and I love it! It keeps me protected and it is not too hot to wear to the beach and leave on for the entire day(even in south Florida). The weird smell remains, but I'd rather deal with that than skin cancer! I bought one in black and it looks nice. I have worn it out to dinner and even to work and nobody noticed it was more of a \"performance wear\" top. I'll be buying one or two more in different colors....the sun is brutal down here! Good bang for your buck.", "Nice shirt for the sun.  Very light material.  Perfect for wearing on a hot day and keeping your skin from burning.  I will use these for golf and fishing in the midday hot southern sun.  The fit is a just slightly smaller than a normal XL so you may want to order one size up.  This shirt is a great bargain compared to similar high end sun protection big logo shirts at four times the price.  You could pay a whole lot more and get the same or less.  Bang for the buck is big if this shirt holds up over time.  I am ordering a few more in different colors.  The material is comfortable next to the skin so you may find yourself wearing it as a base layer.  Seems to wash up nice.  I have looked for a good long sleeve sun shirt for a long time and most of them are too heavy or way overpriced with obnoxious corporate logo's making you a human ad billboard.  I think you will find this sun shirt to be just the right product for the hot sun.  This is my first Vapor product.  I have been wearing these long sleeve Vapor shirts on the golf course in the hot summer sun this past week and they keep you cool and comfortable with minimum sweat factor.  The fit is great and they seem to give easily with activity.  Very impressed with this product - highly recommended!"]},
{"asin": "B00JULZ28U", "comments": ["Today we received an order of 2 black Hanes Beefy t-shirts in Medium.  This was a second order via Amazon in a few months.  My son liked the first set because they were heavy and the fabric doesn't cling.  However, the new shirts we received today are not as thick. They weigh less than the old ones, which have been washed many times.  The new ones have that silky feel that is so common in shirts and bedding now, and which the old ones thankfully lack.  The tags are very different.  Maybe we received fake Hanes shirts.  Disappointed.  In the photo, the left is an old one, and the right is a new (never washed).  My son hasn't tried the new ones on but the size looks approximately the same as the old, albeit the new haven't been washed.", "Believe it or not, men's pocket T-shirts are not easy to find.  My husband only likes T-shirts with pockets and having looked in several stores for them with no luck, I found them on Amazon.com and he was very happy with them when they arrived.  They are of excellent quality and have been washed many times without fading or shrinking.  I won't bother wandering through stores again now that I know that I can get exactly what he wants online!", "I received these yesterday and I washed them first. Be prepared to use a Shout Color Catcher in the wash. The water turned blue and the Shout Color Catcher turned purple from all the blue dye that came out with the first wash of these T Shirts. After drying them in a dryer, and trying them on, they were just a little tight. I ordered a 2X because I knew they would shrink when washed. I wear an X large T Shirt. With these shirts shrinking after the first wash, they fit as an X large now. It is true they are 100% cotton, but they are not preshrunk cotton when you purchase them. Price was good and the thickness of the T Shirt was good. Having a pocket in the T shirt to hold my eye glass case is why I purchased them.  It is hard finding T Shirts with pockets at your local stores. Just remember to buy one size bigger than what you wear.", "My husband wears every other type of Hanes t-shirt in size 2X.  These were too small. Nice feeling shirt but fit at least 1 size if not 2 smaller. He's not gained any weight  or anything so I know for sure it's the shirts.  Luckily they fit my son who usually wears a regular large. So make sure to get at least 1 size larger.", "I have bought Hanes men\u2019s beefy short sleeve T-shirts for years, and would like to rate the product 5 stars. According to my personal experience, these kinds of T-shirts are perfect for adult men who like to wear casual t-shirts at home. First of all, the beefy cotton material gives you a sense of comfortability and steadiness. What\u2019s more, all the terrific color options offer customers a variety of choice. I bought these t-shirts, and wear one of them every single day. It definitely gives me a feeling of freshness every time I suit it up. Besides, the t-shirts launder nicely. So far, after the 4th laundry, I have not found any shrink or fade on these t-shirts. With such a quite reasonable and affordable price, I do not think you could spend less money and get a more comfortable t-shirt.", "These \"Beefy T-Shirts\" used to be more true to size.  I ordered a  Large despite the fact that most of my shirts are Medium, thinking that a little more room might prove more comfortable in the hotter months.  I habitually wash new clothes before wearing them so that anything left over from the manufacturing process may be removed.  These \"large\" t-shirts fit like a smallish medium.  I have had some previous experience with the \"beefy t's\" in years past.  They didn't shrink much, and were durable.  These T-Shirts feel a little less substantial than the ones in memory, and a large t-shirt should not feel like a medium after washing it.Given that the price is good, and the quality OK, as long as you keep in mind that they run a bit small, these shirts may work for you.  They fit me, but are like medium rather than size large.", "I always wear a large in Hanes Beefy T-s, but this last order the size was smaller then what it has been in the past and they fit tight, unlike prior orders of the same t-shirt and size.  Be aware, sizing on these shirts are inconsistent.  Not sure what I'm going to do, I guess I'll send them back.  What a pain in the booty.", "I bought six of these in XL. I'm 5'9 and 160 lbs. I like to wear my shirts loose, so I opt for the XL which shrinks in the wash to a more manageable size for me. They have no stretch. My sizing experience is probably not a lot of help to others. The quality, however, is great. It's made of substantial cotton, thicker than most t-shirts like Champion. These things will last me several years.", "I have found that when I order T-shirts online, they invariably run small.  These \"large\" Hanes shirts fit me, but in terms of size they resemble the medium-size shirts I get from high-quality outfits like that place in Maine.  That said, these Hanes pocket beefy-Ts are really nice shirts.  They're definitely \"beefy\" in terms of the weight of the cloth, they're definitely all cotton (no static at all), and they fit well at the neck and around the chest.  I will be buying more.", "I ordered a number of these, XL, in different colors.  The cut and fit, along with the weight of the material, seems to vary.  After the first wash, they shrank considerably, reducing them down to what other tees would be a 'large.'  On the plus side, they seem to wear well, and with subsequent washings, I'm hoping they will fit just a bit more loosely.  I've really liked the other Beefy-Tees I've had.  All in all, I'd recommend these.  If one tends toward the smaller of their designated size, they may fit well right out of the gate."]},
{"asin": "B00WQMX62E", "comments": ["I used to find these Beefy- tees in Walmart years ago. My husband needs the 2x. Then they stopped carrying them. One day, when my brain was working, I decided to peruse through Amazon. I couldn't believe my luck, when I found the Hanes Beefy tees. So I ordered 12. But you have to know: The ones I purchased at Wal-Mart 10 years ago, are still holding up, (barely). If you are married to a larger size man, or if YOU happen to be one, these are THE best quality t-shirts you'll ever find, or wear. They stand up to hundreds of washings, and the color seletion is superb. But the most important thing to us, is that they are 100% cotten. Best quality for your money.", "I ordered a medium, which according to Haynes is for chests 38-40. My chest is exactly 40. When I tried the shirt on it was skin tight; so tight that I actually had some problems peeling it off. I then measured the shirt front just below the armpits and it was 19\" wide; times two is 38\". This explains why it was so tight for a 40 chest. As far as \"beefy\" was concerned, my opinion is that it's not. It's not thin, but neither is it heavy. Hanes used to sell a true \"beefy\" T, which I wore for probably 10 years, but a few years ago they cheapened the product.I had also been considering buying similar shirts from LL Bean or Land's End, but those cost 3 times as much; around $18 each, I decided to return the Hanes shirts and see what the much higher price of a LL Bean shirt would get me. When the shirts arrived I did some comparisons. The LL Bean shirt chest front measured 22\" (compared to 19\" for the Hanes) and it weighed 7.6  oz compared to 6.5 oz for the Haines; i.e. the LL Bean shirt was beefier than the Hanes, even though it was described as standard weight.Is it worth 3 times the price? Probably not. Just order one size up, don't expect a heavy weight shirt, and you'll probably be happy and definitely richer.", "This shirt is very well made with a thick weave.  The color matches the picture even after repeated washings and there is no noticeable shrinkage even after tumble-drying on my dryer's highest setting.  I also tried applying iron-on transfers made for dark t-shirts to one of them and it worked beautifully.  I would recommend washing the shirt first, however, before trying to apply any iron-on transfer.", "NOT TAGLESS. Pretty sure I got a knock off,  it has 2 cheap big tags. It is not \"beefy\" it is thin. Every other Hanes Beefy Tee(at least 5) I have bought are tagless with thick cotton. Will never buy from this seller again...\"Clothing Shop Online\"", "I don\u2019t know why I just don\u2019t understand that you get what you pay for.I bought two of these, one Royal Blue and one Black.After washing and drying on a low setting, the overall shrinkage was minimal but as I suspected might happen, the bottom of the shirt folds up below the bottom seam. It is almost impossible to get it to fold back. Spraying a mist of water and adding a few clothes pins helps but that\u2019s just ridiculous.In addition to that, the seams where the sleeves are sewn to the body of the shirt are all puckered. It\u2019s impossible to flatten them, even ironing them.They are just plain old garbage and I should have paid double for one shirt...at least I would have had a wearable shirt instead of none.", "Junk!  These used to be like G.I. issue shirts long ago.  Now they include stretched out neck bands which get larger when washed!  I'm sorry I bought them, typical Asia made shirts with poor quality.  Seams were not uniform as well.  I've heard that the Costco shirts may be better.  Amazon did have a good price on these shirts, but I'm sorry that I purchased them.", "This is not \"beefy\" at all! I have a few Hanes Beefy T-shirts from a couple of years back and those are of the real quality: 100% cotton, no BS.The new t-shirt is 90% cotton + 10% polyester: you can see the daylight through the fabric. I's expect these to go through 4-5 wash cycles and become a rag. For the $6 it doesn't worth the trouble of returning it. But be aware.", "I keep coming back to buy more of these.  These are great work shirts and just general usage shirts and the only decent t-shirt with a pocket anymore.* Durability for cheap.  For $7 a shirt you get a fairly beefy cotton that doesn't rip the instant it catches on anything.  It holds up well in the wash.  The dye doesn't seem to fade.  I can't tell the difference between two year old and two month old shirts.* Pocket is nice.  It's big enough to stuff your phone into it, but its better suited to light items that won't fall out due to gravity if you bend forward and stuff that you can clip to the edge of the pocket.  Business cards, paper notes, pens, and small flashlights with pocket clips all do well in the pocket.  If you put a phone in it expect it to flop out on the concrete if you bend forward more than 45 degrees.* Consistency.  I've bought 8 of these so far, two at a time over the course of about two years as I replaced my other work t-shirts.  The sizing has not been altered in that time, nor has the material weight.  I can't even tell the difference between the shirts from two years ago and the most recent ones, they don't even seem to have worn.* Modest cut.  They lean toward the boxy side which is fine if you aren't trying to show off.  If you're a little on the pudgy side it's actually preferable.  When I first got these I was about 195 at 6'1\", two years later I've slimmed down while hitting the weights and sitting at 175 with a little more muscle in my upper torso and considerably less fat around my waist.  If you want to turn any heads or catch any eyes this is not your go to t-shirt.", "A few months ago I ordered a sample of these tshirts. They fit perfect and were nice and beefy. However after I reordered this time with the same seller, these tshirts were not the same. They were a lot thinner material and they did not have the tagless style. It seems like Hanes sold out just like the Rast of the t-shirt companies and opted for cheaper thin stretchy material. Very disappointing, since this was the last resort for thicker tshirts. They'll say it was the same thickness bit standards have definitely changed. I have the comparisons right here In front of me. I hate wasting money buying cloths online when they keep getting cheaper with quality.", "I think this is a knock off.  The shirt has tags and shrunk considerably in the first wash.  This is not a Hanes Beefy Tee quality shirt.  Must be a fake."]},
{"asin": "B00KQFK8FQ", "comments": ["I got these shirts for my dad. Love him to death but he has a bit of a sweating problem that needed some serious attention :) haha. He works as a doctor so he wears dress shirts a lot of the time when he's seeing patients throughout the day. He's always worn an undershirt when he's working, and not working, but with those dress shirts, especially on warmer days in an office you tend to sweat and sweat tends to soak through your clothes and is then visible. He use to wear the regular cotton material undershirts but those would just end up getting wet and yucky by the end of the day, so I did some research for him and found these!!! They work amazing and he loves them. He says they're extremely lightweight and comfortable and unlike his other undershirts, when he sweats he doesn't feel the wetness of the sweaty shirt on his body all day. He doesn't even notice this undershirt is there! And the nicest part about the shirts is that they keep there nice pure white color! Even if you do mix your laundry load with colors and darks these will stay white and look nice under thinner/light color shirts! I ordered a large for him and that fit him perfectly. He was also a large in the regular undershirts!", "I've used Hanes shirts for a base layer under my dress clothing for some time, but had traditionally used the cotton shirts only.  After reading up on cotton and the comparison to polyester fabrics, I found that while cotton will soak up sweat, it does not dry quickly, and holds the moisture next to your body, causing all kinds of issues.Instead, these shirts are the \"dri fit\" type of fabric - soft to the touch, comfortable, and most importantly, they pull sweat away from the body and help it to rapidly evaporate.I have worn these shirts under dress clothes with positive results, but also tested them by wearing them as a base layer when out hiking and working up a sweat.  These shirts stayed comfortable, and I stayed pretty dry even though I was sweating.  I highly recommend these shirts, and have already bought more for myself.", "I ordered an adult small for my 5ft 100lb daughter to wear for a soccer try out. I had asked on here if the shirt fit more like a tshirt or like an undershirt. I can say it fits more like a tshirt. It was just right for what we needed.", "These great Hanes shirts fit true to American sizes if not just a very small \"over\" and they wear extremely cool and breath so well that a really hot day is not so bad at all. Hanes hit a homer with these and I have now ordered three colors in packs of two. The very, very low prices for the packs of two cannot be beaten and you can even mix and match the colors but watch your pricing as some combinations ARE NOT Amazon Prime and have higher prices with freight charged. The care is as simple as throwing them into the cold wash with similar colors. Hang on hangers and air dry or they can be dried on low heat and takes less than ten minutes on medium.  toss into the wash with any type clothes.One of the best values I have found on Amazon. Buy them. No regrets!", "I work in a very hot environment and cotton shirts get soaked and stay wet in 5 minutes.  This shirt stays dry and it feels like I've got a tiny brezeze cooling me under the shirt all day as I work.  It doesn't stop you from staying wet and sweaty but it's much better than anything else I've tried.  Can't say about longevity but quality is good and I expect them to last.  I wish they were a little smaller- I got the normal Large size and do wonder if a Medium would fit better.  I don't care for an over sized under-shirt", "I'm a size medium for all of my shirts (including other Hanes brand shirts), but in these shirts I'm a size small. The mediums were very large and baggy on me and fit like a large normally would. I'm 5'9\" 165lbs. I wear these under my bulletproof vest at work every day during the summer and they do a far better job wicking the moisture away compared to cotton t-shirts. They keep me cool and comfortable for 8+ hours a day, and don't cut into my arm pits like the UA heat gear shirts I bought for ten times the price. All in all was a great purchase, and I would buy again.", "I thought these felt plasticy when i first tried them out but stopped noticing it after 2 days of wearing these to work. Much better than cotton for keeping cool. The shirt will still get pretty moist if youre producing a lot of sweat but does not become an oven when it does. Dries out much faster than cotton once you greet a chance to rest.  Shirts did not shrink after the first wash. Have a glossy shine to them vs cotton.Hanes has these for a better deal on their site, more colors, and you don't have to buy 2 packs for the better price. You just have to be willing to accept standard shipping vs prime. Ordered 11 to add to the 2 i already have.", "These are wonderful Tee shirts. They have a quality fit and finish that would be admirable for an outer garment. Their smooth, classy look and feel are entirely different than that of an ordinary cotton Tee shirt. Originally, I bought them for a trip planning to wash and dry them myself in my hotel room and let them dry overnight. That worked out very well. Now, I launder them with my dress shirts. They come out looking brand new after each wash.", "At only $14 for two red shirts, I wasn't expecting too much. Wicking shirts are hit and miss even when you buy them at a sports store. But when I got the shirts, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the material and attention to detail. The shirts fit just right and the price is right. Granted, I would have preferred to have a red shirt along with another color, but those options were like $29 so that wasn't going to happen.In any case, the Hanes Short Sleeve Cool DRI T-Shirt is a quality shirt and performs well out on the trail. I have included a photo of it on the trail when you can see so long as Amazon doesn't strip the photo out. If they do, I will probably be writing a gear review for this shirt on my dayhikingtrails.com blog. Cheers!", "I have purchased multiple colors of these shirts and absolutely love them. From around the house to working in the yard. They keep you cool. All the other colors I purchased were great until I purchased these. They have a bug spray smell that I cannot seem to wash out. I\u2019ve laundered them multiple times and once I put these on I can smell bug spray. All the other colors white, navy blue, grey, white, and black don\u2019t have the smell. All are the same size and brand but these just flat out stink and are all but unwearable. That being said these by far are the most comfortable and cool shirts I own hints why I purchased multiple colors. If you want to be cool and comfortable these are perfect. Even in direct sunlight you will not sweat. I have mowed the yard in the sun and remained cool. Just flat out awesome."]},

Also they do not come in the original Polo By Ralph Lauren silver and blue bags. They come in a after market clear regular bag. These also lack the official stitching of real authentic Ralph Lauren shirts, you can not see the stitching around the collar, arm, or waist. This material is more like a Hanes undershirt and they are manufactured in unusual countries that Ralph Lauren does not list on its site. If you pay attention to the shirts and take time to examine you can see they are fake. The ponys on the shirt also are slightly different, there is excess stitch that is rough and goes across the legs instead of going behind. Also if you flip the shirt inside out you can see it is a regular shirt because they left the white shirt tags on the inside, and the tags have different locations and washing instructions that that on the collar. These are counterfeit shirts sold at a high price.", "I have purchased several of these Polo T shirts. There is NO Quality Control.

{"asin": "B075ZZF47B", "comments": ["I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8\" and 140\", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked as well.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer. Also, I think that the Gilden shrank significantly in the first wash. The shrinkage seemed to be in t in the shoulders and in the length. I would say that the T-shirt went from a large to a medium. It still fits but I had wanted a large T-shirt, not a medium.  I washed the T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.", "My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.", "Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.A great find!", "I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.", "These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.", "These are my husband's favorite shirts, they are thick and durable. We will be buying more.", "Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like.

I'm satisfied with the purchase.", "In general, I\u2019m a picky shopper in terms of quality, but when it comes to undershirts, I only need something of decent quality but at a good price.As a point of reference, for my own use, three Calvin Klein v-neck undershirts at Costco for $19.99 cost more than what I felt was necessary for me (they are definitely of better quality though).So I found these Gildans and gave them a try.  The fact that they cost less than $2 per undershirt worried me so I wasn't expecting much, but they are actually better than expected, given the very reasonable price!  I laundered them once before wearing one, and my initial impression is that they fit great (I ordered Medium size, and I\u2019m a size 39 chest &amp; 33 waist) and are of very acceptable quality considering the price.I then compared them to some old Costco Kirkland V-neck T-Shirts that I\u2019ve had for a very long time.  These Gildans are a lighter thinner cotton, so their durability wash after wash remains to be seen, but I initially have absolutely no complaints for the price.The Gildan cotton definitely feels rougher than the Kirklands, but not enough to prevent me from buying more Gildans for the price. The stitching on the Gildans is not as smooth or refined as the Kirkland\u2019s, but again totally acceptable given the price point.In the end, as long as you aren\u2019t shopping for premium quality, IMHO I feel this is a very good deal on a set of 6 acceptable quality undershirts, and I found them even better than expected.  If durability holds up after a reasonable amount of washes, I definitely plan to buy these again.", "I'd heard of\u00a0Gildan Platinum Men's 6-Pack Ringspun Arch Black Ankle Sock, Black, Sock Size: 10-13/Shoe Size:9-11\u00a0before, but I wasn't aware that they made t-shirts and boxer briefs, too.These are very comfortable and so far they're holding their shape well.", "I bought this for my husband.

The only problem I've ever had with them is they shrink just a tiny bit every time you wash them in hot water, so they become too small before they wear out. But for the price that's a perfectly acceptable problem to have.However, this year I bought 3 six packs of these shirts, and they're all trash. They've reduced the amount of cotton they use to the point they're nearly see-through. The quality control is non-existent, as each package of shirts seems to be made from a different pattern. One package, the shirts were too short. Another package, the sleeves were too short. The last package, the sleeves were too narrow. I've washed these shirts twice, and already half of them have shrunk to an entirely different size while the other half haven't, and two of the eighteen shirts have already torn at the V.I will never buy these shirts again.", "I'm 5'8\" and about 160. Bought the Medium as per the size chart.

Quality is standard for undershirts; not too thin as to see through but not too thick as to add bulk and heat.", "I've bought 3-4 pack of these T-shirt! Previously, for many years I was wearing the A-type shirt or muscle shirt only. Over the years, I've noticed that my dress shirt, which I  wear daily to work, were wearing out at the armpits.  Yes, the arm pits stain were destroying my pricey dress shirt.  No amount of deodorant/antiperspirant was helpful. I had to throw away so many because no amount of washing can get rid of the stains. Finally, I decided to ditch the A-shirt and switch to full T-shirt as my undershirt and haven't look back. These shirts aren't fancy, they feels like normal T-shirt, and are comfortable. I wear these 100% of the time now. It had certainly saved me money over the years because I don't have to replace my dress shirt nearly as often. As for sizing, I'm 5'5, 160 lbs, and I fit a medium size. Don't hesitate and buy it. Think of it as an investment to keep your dress shirt nice and clean.

These have held up to washes very well and have shrunk maybe the tiniest amount. Love the softness of these shirts as well, and the absence of a tag is great. The price on Amazon for these shirts is much better than the stores around me are offering, so I'll probably order more from here when need arises.", "Medium (5'7\" 150lbs) was too big before wash, shrunk to be entirely too small after one wash.

The shirts were way too big, x-large maybe even xx, it says on the shirts its a large.  Put it through first wash and wear it, the shirt shrunk at least two sizes.

They still fit really well.The material feels nice and soft, not too thick, and not too thin. My primary use for these are as undershirts, and they are comfortable in this regard (a combination of having no tags, the right thickness, the right length and fitting snugly). They are a bit longer than normal medium t-shirts (at least those that I currently own), but this helps them to stay tucked in during the day - at least for persons like me, who don't do a lot of stretching and other stuff that would ensure your shirt gets untucked.I'd recommend these to anyone looking for undershirts.", "They're a steal for the price. I thought I was getting 2 black/2 grey, but the pack came with all grey (not a problem, but FYI for anyone curious). The arms fit me well. The length hits around the hip. The cut of the torso is very slim. While not tight, it does feel like it outlines my torso, rather than shirts that are a little loose and \"drape\" a couple inches (if that makes sense?). If you have a gut or don't like slim/athletic fit, size up one size. Lastly, the shirts are VERY thin and I would not wear it by itself.Overall, it serves my intended purpose which is a thin undershirt for wearing under dress shirts.", "I have some Hanes T-shirts that have seen their better day. Thought I would buy more on Amazon instead of a local store. Received the package and was disappointed with the weight of the T-shirts. Pretty thin. My older versions were a bit thicker.

Medium fits how I like (5 ft 11, 175lbs) and the fabric and finish is great. The pocket option is cool too.", "I\u2019m a bit picky with my T-shirt\u2019s. As a taller guy leaning on the chubby side, finding a good fitting T-shirt is difficult. Most I come across may be great in width but come extremely short in the length, or great in length but a bit narrower in the fit. These hit the perfect proportions for me. The fit and length are perfect. The cotton is also extremely high quality feeling compared to shirts around the same price point. I\u2019d go so far to say they feel like the premium line of Polo Ralph Lauren T\u2019s (but better fitting). The sleeves are perfect length and having put them through a few laundry cycles, the collar hasn\u2019t stretched out or started to curl.They\u2019re just really damn good shirts, and at $15 a pop, you can grab a few of them without breaking the bank."]},

Not only do they look good, but they FEEL good as well!  Hunter Green and Navy Blue are two of the best colors for my liking.  Additionally, I can also guess that these will likely last a lot longer than the two shirts I had originally, seeing as these are made with thicker material and are seemingly FAR sturdier.  I will definitely buy more Dickies clothes down the road.", "Candidate for plumbers crack, I own dozens of Dickies work shirts, all had been purchased at Walmart and the price kept getting higher and higher. Found these on Amazon and ordered 3, luckily I only ordered 3 since I am highly disappointed in the quality and fit of these shirts. I wonder if these are bootleg products? The color fades very quickly, I have old Dickies shirts that have more color than these do and these have only been washed maybe a dozen times. The biggest problem I have is the tails of these shirts are shorter than the ones I buy at Walmart, I spend a lot of time bending, stretching and kneeling at work and I am constantly tucking the tail of these shirts back in, they are a good 1 to 2 inches shorter than the Dickies I buy at Walmart. The Walmart shirts rarely have to be tucked back in but with these it is constant and never ending, it is to the point I don't even want to wear these shirts to work, brand new shirts that I will only wear to mow the grass or lounge around the house what a waste of money, I will not be buying more of these shirts from Amazon.", "Carhartt wins hands down. I haven't purchased one of these Dickie's shirts in years and I was somewhat disappointed at the quality of the fabric. The fabric is thinner than I remember and it itches without an undershirt on. The Carhartt shirts on the other hand are a lot thicker and I prefer the way the buttons are placed....with Dickies there is an odd distance between the top button and the next to last button. However Dickies has Carhartt beat on colors hands down. I needed a dark brown work shirt and this was the only one available that I liked. If you live in a warmer climate these will be fine but don't expect a heavy duty work shirt. You will still get a decent shirt and the style is classic.....but it is a little different than what the Dickies shirts I wore in the 80's. Fit is good if not a little \"loose\". Order you regular Dickies sizing. I am an XL at 5'10\" 220 lbs.", "I'd say this item fits a little large - except that that's exactly how it should. The fabric is unstretchy, and I feel will surely last years and years, as it feels so durable. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not cotton, either, and you shouldn't expect to be reaching for these for a day of lounging on the couch after busting ass all month, wearing them.I presume they'll take wear very well, but they're not exactly super comfortable.", "Excellent shirts, very comfortable, and made very well, but the sizing is pretty far off. I typically fit a 2XL in most brands very well, so that's what I ordered for these. Unfortunately, despite being my normal size, I swim in them. They're absolutely massive. It almost seems like a set of 3x or 4x shirts got the wrong tags. Having said that, I ordered this model shirt two each in three different colors, and the fit for all 6 was identical, so apparently it's just how they're made. They're made well and very comfortable, so I'd definitely recommend them, but make sure you go down a size or two from your normal.", "Perfect shirt for a summer wedding.  Dressy-ish, without being too formal.  Because it's a durable work shirt, it was a little stiff, but after washing with a lot of fabric softener, it feels much better.", "I bought several work shirts in different colors since they were on sale. The dark brown one I received came in plastic packaging without the standard cardboard dickies labels that you typically get with these shirts. I didn't think much of it until I started to inspect the shirt. The brand tag on the back of the neck is different than regular shirts I have purchased. I don't want to make false claims but it doesn't seem like a regular dickies work shirt. Other ones I have purchased show sizing using a letter indicating whether it's small, large or so on. This particular tag uses a numerical size rating. This shirt also came with a missing button hole for the bottom button. On these shirts, there should be a dickies tag on the bottom of the shirt near the last button and this shirt did not have that. I also lined up this shirt alongside the other dickies work shirt to notice any other differences regarding construction. This shirt doesn't seem to line up the same with the stitchings as if the pattern for the material cutouts they used for the individual pattern pieces are different for this particular shirt. I can also notice that the stitching and spacing for the pen hole in the pocket are different than the other ones I have. Overall I am disappointed in this purchase and will probably order directly from dickies next time."]},

He normally wears an xlarge in shirts, so this is true to size.", "I have a few athletic shirts like this.  They all dry quickly; hence, the \"Dri\" brand name. But keep in mind that none leave you feeling like you haven't sweat.  Don't expect a dry shirt after the workout - if you put in the work, you will get these soaked.  With that said I love the feel, how it hangs (never grabs the skin, even when wet), and the light weight.  I regularly choose these style shirts over cotton.  I wear them alone - no undershirt.  I've chosen this brand twice, and the big/tall 2xl (I'm 6'4\", 260lbs, 3-5-mile runner most days) covers nicely whether I'm working abs, running or raising weights above my head - I never have to worry about the shirt being too short.  Wash on cold, dry on low or let hang dry (will hang dry in 4 hours).  I never machine-dry completely.  They stand up nicely to wrinkles, so fold and place a few in your gym bag.

I tend to sweat like I stole something most of the time, and wearing a cotton undershirt in the office meant I spent most of the day in a damp shirt.

Very thin, silk like material.  I had my doubts.  I have to say, though, that this shirt is now my favorite workout shirt.  It's very light, cool, and covers my gut through all types of exercises in the gym.  I'm 6'0 215 and this shirt gives me about 4-5 inches below the waist and also plenty of length in the sleeves.  The Large was not too loose and not too tight - just right to feel good but show off the guns :)  I think for a shirt with no major label / brand, it should be a few bucks cheaper, but I will buy more.  I'm spoiled with the lightweight feel.  Let's hope other colors are consistent with sizing.", "Great t-shirt/undershirt. Unlike cotton these dry quickly both right out of the wash, hung up (they never go in the dryer) and when worn and you are sweating. I got the tall version so they stay tucked in, and they do. Even if you've been moving around these stay nicely. Yes, I've seen a few stray threads and and had to have a small section of hem resewn on one, otherwise no issues. The white ones I've owned for over a year have remained white and look crisp and clean showing at the neck of a dress shirt, nor have the collars lost shape.If anything could be improved it would be the way this material holds odor especially after one wearing on hot days.

We ordered a shirt in a size LARGER than my husband would normally wear and when the shirt arrived it was still too small and tight (both length and width). It was certainly pink enough though and we gave it to my father-in-law who is smaller than my husband and it fit him perfectly.

A few years back Champion was bought out by Fruit of the Loom and the fabric got lighter, and the cut got skimpy--now resembling the Fruit of the Loom tee shirts.I then switched to Dickies (regular weight) which I can buy at Walmart.  It featured an even heavier fabric and an even more generous cut than the Champion tees of old.  I am happy with the Dickies standard weight tees.  But Walmart carries them in on black, white and gray only.  I wanted colors.I ordered the Dickies heavy weight. When it arrived I tossed it in the laundry along with a brand new Dickies standard weight.  When they were laundered I handled both and they did not feel much different.  I examined the construction and they appear to be the same quality (excellent).  The heavy weight was made in Nicaragua, and the standard weight was produced in the Honduras.  But both seem of similar assembly quality.I decided to weigh them on my kitchen scale:  Stardard weight (XL) 9.25 ounces; Heavy weight (XL) 9.75 ounces a difference of 1/2 ounce (5.26%).  Hardly a heavy weight.So if you are not interested in colors, I recommend the standard weight; if you want the colors go with the heavy weight.If you want a true heavy weight tee I only know of Duluth Trading whose tees are of a true heavy weight fabric and the cut is generous but the product is expensive.  I find the Dickies to be a much better value.  For tall men, the Dickies are available in a \"tall\" too.A good product, but not really a heavy weight.", "Not enough people put their body dimensions on here to make sizing an unseen/unknown shirt easy.I'm a guy - so I don't care if you know my specs - here they are:6' 5\" tall310 lbs23\" technical torso measurement (back of neck to waist line)21\" armpit to waist line54\" chest18\" pythons (biceps for you skinny hipsters)Usually I buy shirts in 2 XL, 2 XLT, or 3X.Normally I buy shirts with the \"tall\" designation since my gut sticking out typically makes a \"non-tall\" shirt rise just to the point of showing skin when I lean back or reach up with my arm(s). No one wants to see that - unless that is your \"thing\"I went with the 2XLT version of this as a baseline.Results:100% cotton shrinks even if it \"preshrunk.\" Pre-shrunk does not shrink as much, but there is a noticeable shrink none the less.New from package w/ no wash - length was fine - fit was snug, but not too much to show off the moobs or gut too badly.First wash - length still fine - fit was too tight - moobs and gut sticking out like an over packed sausage - not flattering.-You can pull the shirts to stretch it out to be less form fitting, but I don't want to mess with that after every wash.Returned both 2 XLT's and went with a 3X regular length.3X reg length is good enough (unless reaching with arms up as far as I can) - fit is quite loose on the moobs and gut (read comfortable and flattering), but not to tent proportions.Shirt really is heavyweight and I love it. Can't see through it and looks like it will last a while, just like most Dickies items do!Pocket is a touch too tight/small for my Galaxy S5 with case since they seamed in a dedicated pen/pencil pouch inside the total front pocket dimensions. As is, it is good enough to hold a couple pens or something along the size of a deck of cards.Ask your grandma, mother, or wife for a seam ripper to remove the Dickies tag on the front pocket. If they are good with the stitch, ask them to rip out the dedicated pen/pencil pouch and the pocket becomes big enough for a smart phone.I used to buy Fruit of the Loom Men's Short Sleeved Pocket T-Shirt from both the Normal and Best collections since they used to be available locally in a \"mart\" store. That Wal place doesn't carry the front pocket shirt in my sizes anymore so I found them here on Amazon. FotL changed their material/construction practices with this shirt recently and they are bad quality, even at $5-$8 a pop.  They lasted me about 6 months of 1-2x/week use and one weekly washing before fabric was worn thin and piling badly.

Heavy Weight Cotton2. Will survive going through the washer more than a dozen times.3. Minimal shrinkage after washing/drying4. Not See-Through -- no secondary shirt needed5. Little to no graphics6. Tag-lessThe Dickies t-shirts exceeded our expectations. The t-shirts are the thickness of the cotton that used to be the norm in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's.  Most t-shirt companies have made the cotton thinner, and thinner and thinner. To the point the men might start wearing man bra's. The Dickies t-shirts do not have obnoxious graphics added (which is also hard to find). The front pock contains a small Dickies logo. Another positive, the inside back neck is \"tag-less\".We like these t-shirts so much, that I'm tempted to order another dozen or two for upcoming years.", "I love these shirts. I now own around 12 in various darker colors. They are great fitting and nicely made. The material is indeed thicker than usual, yet not heavy or stifling in heat. They do have two problems, however: 1) The colors fade, and some of them do so very quickly. Gray seems to hold up best. Green and brown are losing a lot of color saturation with every single wash. 2) These things are oil STAIN MAGNETS. You may not notice anything while wearing them or doing the laundry, but later, it's not uncommon to take a \"clean\" one off the hanger and notice a few spots, then throw it right into the hamper. None of my other shirts do this, from cheap 100% cotton tees to poly blends.For both of these problems, I'm only knocking off one star because I really do love these shirts otherwise. There must be something that other manufacturers are doing to protect their fabric, but Dickies is not. For now, I'm keeping a bottle of\u00a0Grandma's Secret GS7001 Laundry Spray, 16-Ounce\u00a0near the washing machine. I've found it works fairly well.

In this case I took the suggestions about going up a size again due to these running small?So XL normally works and I like the shirt tail to be longer so I want to tuck them in and they will stay put!Based on the reviews here, I ordered the 2XLT, so when these arrive the seam between the upper part of the sleeves and the shoulder rides just over the top of my shoulder, but the sleeve are still a bit short by 3/4 to even a full inch. They had a bit better fit before washing and I don't use a dryer for most of my cloths. Anyway, I'm keeping the shirts, the collar seems to be well made and keep it's shape so that's important as well.Note: Shirts from another order were made in Pakistan and were not stated as being \"heavyweight\" shirts.they feel about the same (a bit softer maybe) and yet the fitting is better with about 1/2 in more sleeve than ones from this order, which were made Nicaragua? Laying both out seam to seam and the sleeve on the Pakistan was a bit longer than those from Nicaragua, both shirts had been washed twice!IMO - the material that is being used today vs. the past are not going to hold up as well as shirts from late 80's and early 90's which in my case held up well past 20 years or more and many were made in the USA.", "I've been buying these shirts for over 10 years.

I've ordered several of these Dickies shirts, and about every other order, Amazon sends me 1 or more of the wrong size.  The most common mistake is they send me a \"3XL\" instead of the \"3XLT\" I ordered.  If it doesn't have the \"T\", it isn't a tall shirt!  Check every shirt you order.  I've had orders where some were correct and others were wrong.  I'veeven had two shirts of the same color in the same order where 1 will be a tall and other other won't.  Amazon customer service tells me they are sending in requests for the warehouse to check stock, but I still get the wrong shirts.  The difference between tall and regular is 2-3\" and for me makes the difference between being able to tuck the shirt in or not.Overall, I'd give the shirts 4.75 stars.  They seem to be very well constructed.  Based on how thin some other shirts I\u2019ve bought are, these could easily be considered heavy fabric.  The actual thickness of the fabric varies a bit between different colors.  I am both big and tall, so it is unheard for me to find good T's for $8-12/ea.There is a paper label around waist high which you will want to cut off, it rustles.

Some are a little roomier than others.  The label recommends washing in cold.  I HIGHLY recommend washing in cold.  The shirts tend to shrink a little the first couple times they are washed.I always wash mine in cold and hang them up to dry, but still had that little bit of shrinkage.  The most comfortable: Dark Navy and Black Olive.  They started out very roomy and even after a bit of shrinkage are still quite comfortable.  Chocolate and Lincoln Green just barely still fit.  Desert Sand started out ok, but after two washings it had shrunk enough that it is a little small.  I find I'm yanking on it to stretch it.Don't take the Amazon listing picture colors too seriously.  I've included a pic of the actual shirts.  Chocolate and Dark Olive appear lighter in my photo than they do in person.", "Possibly the best crew neck T I've owned.  Love the fit. Its comfortable, and the collar doesn't loosen after a day of working in it. There is a WORLD of difference between these and the standard Gildan/Hanes tees available at Walmart or similar stores.

First, if your a big guy, NFL, lumberjack, you'll probably love this shirt.  I'm 5'11, 165 lbs, career military.  This fits me nice in the shoulders and chest, but hangs like a dress around my middle, because there is NO shape or form fitting.  I could live with that.  Wouldn't be the first shirt made for larger people that I have to have tailored to fit me below the chest, but here's the real kicker.  There's something about the design of the sleeves and the weight of the fabric that causes the whole shirt to lift up and bunch around the chest and neck if I lift my arms up shoulder height or higher.  That's definitely something you don't want in a T-Shirt that is supposed to be soft and comfortable.  This cotton is pretty stiff.  Maybe after a few washes it'll be softer, but it seems like a fairly stiff weave.  It certainly doesn't hang/drape like the pictures shown.  Lastly, the pocket, as shown in the picture, wraps around the side of the chest and is largely useless except for keeping a pen in.  It does have a separate little pen spot in the pocket, but the opening is too small to use most modern pens with a rubberized grip.  So, all in all, pretty disappointing for me."]},

Needless to say, we've used many brands over the years. I decided to try these this time I purchased his white tees based on the reviews and the price. I did go one size up from his usual size (Large) to an XLarge based on a few reviews regarding sizing. They fit perfectly. Not too big anywhere. They're not super tight around the neck like some under shirts can be, which drives my husband nuts. They are very soft right out of the packaging and haven't lost that softness with multiple times through the washer and dryer. I don't use fabric softener. I use wool balls as a natural fabric softener. So no chemical is being used to keep them soft. That's a plus for me because it means it's quality fabric.I actually purchased 3 white tshirts by Jockey at the same time I purchased these. I washed them all. Dried them all. Folded them all mixed together and placed them in a stack. I could see the difference. These are a bit thinner than the Jockeys. They aren't quite as white as Jockey. The sizing was nearly exactly the same as a Jockey Large. I wanted to see if my husband noticed a difference. He didn't!I've had these a few weeks now. They launder just fine. If there has been shrinkage it's been minimal and not noticeable. They still look brand new. Of course, in time I know they will wear out. All under shirts do when they are used as frequently as my husband must wear them. However, I'm pleased with them. My husband hasn't complained about them and trust me he WOULD complain if the shirts didn't feel right or fit correctly.I do think Jockey is a better quality overall, but I would buy these again. I do think they will break down sooner than the Jockey tees due to the thin material they're made of and the fact that these tshirts are worn, waged and dried A LOT. However, I would still recommend them. They are good quality and will last someone else a long time if they aren't been worn almost daily. This is a great deal for two quality white tshirts.**I would consider sizing up one size.**", "Finally a basic black tshirt in size medium that is long enough !

I have bought Hanes ComfortSoft shirts before, and what I received are definitely not them.The ComfortSoft shirts are supposed to be tagless so that the collar is not irritating in any way, with the Hanes logo/material/size printed on the fabric directly. The shirts I received had the shirt material and size printed on the cotton, but the Hanes logo was on a tag sewn into the collar....The picture shows shirts without a tag......The section from the manufacturer says \"All the comfort of Hanes with our famous tag-free collar,\"...BUT, the description that Amazon listed says \"White neck tag easily removed for tag-free comfort,\" yet the tag is sewn into the collar. So, clearly, these are not the ComfortSoft shirts, so both the picture and the manufacturer's description are not relevant to what Amazon ships out. Oh, and how is this tag easily removed? Well, I could cut it off and leave a short, sharp, scratchy protrusion of tag sticking out of the collar, or I could rip the stitching, remove the tag, and then re-sew it back together. \"Easily removed?\" Definitely not.The only thing that deserves any credit is that the sizing was as expected, a Medium.

They do shrink up A LOT.  I ordered a second pack and compared one to a shirt I had been washing/wearing and there was a difference of several inches in length, at least an inch in sleeve, and probably a couple inches in chest.

This is the second time I purchased these and the only issue I've noticed is that one shirt in the first package seemed to be slightly smaller than the others.

I found these and figured even if they weren't long enough that they would be comparable to what he was already wearing, but they are perfect! Extra long without being too big everywhere else.

Yes, these shrink quite a lot in the length.  Interestingly they did not really shrink at all around the chest/waist dimension.A couple other issues I had with these, that I have not had with other brands is that the seam along the bottom of the shirt and around the ends of the arms was not flat. If these were not meant as undershirts I envision I would be going through and having to do some serious ironing to ensure all the seams were down nicely.Lastly, the elastic around the neck seems to be of lower quality material and is not as taunt as I guess I would prefer.

We submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a 20% restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying.

I only buy a few duplicates of my favorites because I'm liable to get oil stains on any and all pieces of clothing I own for some reason.Anyway, highly recommend these - they fit great around the arms, the V isn't too deep, and they aren't overly long (I'm 5'7\" and they taper off perfectly around pockets on most of my pants). They also fit a bit snugly toward the bottom - doesn't look like a loose tshirt hanging all over the place.Size wise they're what you'd expect.

I have to wear undershirts to work, and I've had a hard time consistently finding comfortable shirts with a good cotton-poly blend. All-cotton shirts always end up with stretched out necks, looking saggy, etc. These shirts are absolutely perfect.

There are small tags in the neck, which initially upset me, but as I went to cut them out, they pull out with minimal tension, almost as if they're stuck on with velcro instead of sewn. I was able to get them off without damaging the neck seam in any way.

I thought I wanted cotton, but the 50/50 blend and the light weight really works much better than my heavy cotton shirts which just get heavy with sweat as opposed to these shirts which are light enough to dry as I hike.My one gripe is that of the 4 shirts I bought, THREE of them sprung a hole in the same place - the seam on the arm right by the cuff. The seam came open and on one of the unraveled so that the whole cuff came off. I put a few stitches on the seam near the cuff on the others and they've been fine.", "I bought this shirt to use as part of a Halloween costume and didn't really plan on wearing it after that.

The fabric feels great, and the bright red really does pop. The sleeves are a good length for me, something which is not always the case with shirts since i have long arms. I purchased a size larger than normal half-expecting the shirt to run small, but this was not the case. It fits exactly as I'd hoped a shirt of the size up would, which is great for me really since I prefer baggier clothes to tighter. I am very happy with this shirt, the price was right, and it's exactly what I was looking for.", "The shirt was delivered promptly with no defects. Personally I am looking for a work shirt. This shirt seams light weight and a bit on the stretchy side. Cotton blend might be a little excessive for my purposes. The only thing I didn't really like about the shirt is that the length is a bit short. the fact that it's a little more slippery than a cotton shirt makes it fairly likely that it's. It going to stay in my belt through a work day. So at least in my case it's not really a great work shirt but lesson learned. If you need it for another reason especially if you need good ventilation and movement with a comfortable feel on your skin this is a good value for the money.", "I've been buying a lot of long sleeve shirts lately to replace old ones.  I've tried a few different brands and this is one of my favorites.  I did buy XXL even though I'm typically an XL.  I've found recently that XL is more like a Large, so I'm buying XXL first now.

These Slim Fit shirts are significantly tighter fitting in the stomach, arms, and chest area(s). The Regular Fit shirts are much looser in all three of these areas, especially the arms.Compared to a Regular Fit I would categorize these as a Slim Fit not, a Snug Fit; they fit close to the body but not tightly enough to show something like muscle definition, if that's what you're looking for.For comparison, I would say that these  Amazon Essentials Slim Fit t-shirts are tighter fitting than a standard Gap or Old Navy t-shirt fit but looser fitting than a standard American Apparel or H&amp;M t-shirt fit.Overall the quality is nice, with minimal fading and only very minor shrinkage after laundering in cold water and putting in a medium dryer.

I've been trying to get these specific designed of shirts for a reasonable price, unlike those sold by YouTubers and other fitness-community fam like Gymsharks or Alphalete. I was skeptic at first in terms of fit since I've never worn clothes that is designed like this so I went for my 2 types of sizes that I would normally wear: my regular size of Large and also a Medium to see how it fits. Overall, both fits me well out of the bag/fresh from delivery (more on that later). I'm 5'8\" and 177 lbs. As you can see by the picture, I'm not too muscular nor overweight, just a good mixture of fatness and muscle--roughly 20% - 21% body fat. Anyway, I am wearing a MEDIUM here and my arms are hugging the sleeves and so is my pecs (chest) and it's nicely tapered down and shapes my lower body/waist area. Now for the large, I didn't take a picture, but basically it's almost the same minus the sleeves not hugging my arms as much and also it's slightly longer. BUT I washed and machine dried both of them right away like I would for any of my clothes and both the large and medium shrank a tiny bit, though not enough to make it unwearable. Overall, these are great and fits as expected not only for outing but also wearing it at the gym. I love my first 2 pairs that I instantly ordered some more since, why not? The price is right and it makes anyone out there refresh their looks by having a versatile and stylish shirt in or out of the gym!Note: you dont' necessarily need to be a gym goer to wear these by the way. Anybody can wear it, plus it makes you stand out of the crowd since the design of the shirt is not very common unlike your regular t-shirt or v-neck!", "I bought an XL in this because a men's XL usually leave me plenty of room to wash and dry without too much shrinkage.  Since I had never bought this brand before, I washed it in cold water and hung it up to dry - no heat ever touched this shirt!  Not only did it shrink a little in the chest, it shrunk considerably in length.  Before washing, I had extra room in the chest and it was long enough to cover my rear end.  After, it's a little snug across the chest and only comes halfway down my rear end.  I would recommend sizing up at least 2 sizes if you want to have some room after washing.", "Really good nice product", "I read reviews before buying this shirt and saw that it is a little thin and the stiching is not the best. I figured still worth a shot for the cost. I was plesantly surprised. The shirt i got was not as thin as i had imagined it is still thin but also soft and comfy. It did shrink a little after first two washes but again i expected that. The stiching is light and can easily be ripped but again for the cost this is not as bad as i expected. I got the 2xl and im 6 foot 2 280lbs with a large chest. I was worried the bottom of the shirt would be clingy but it actually fits really well. I was hoping for a little longer so i may go up a size on the next one but only for length reasons.", "Update: I just ordered a second one in white to replace the first one that I got which was sewed crooked. This one is a completely different fit and length. It is way longer than the first one I had and a little slimmer throughout. I wish it fit as nicely as the first one minus the defect. I won't be ordering another one of these. I'm very disappointed, I feel like I'm wearing a nightgown with this one.Original review:This shirt fits perfectly. I really love the way it hangs. Unfortunately, I'm giving it 3 stars for the poor quality control. The shirt was sewed crooked and the scalloped bottom was totally asymmetrical, off to one side. The seams on each side were in two completely different places. One side seemed to be in the correct spot, while the other side was clear around on the side of my back! Fortunately, Amazon refunded me. I'm reluctant to order another white one and have the same issue be happening, despite how much I loved the fit of the shirt.I also ordered the charcoal grey colored shirt in the same size and it fits entirely differently. It's much longer and more narrow. It felt and looked too tight for me. I had to return it.Perhaps I'll get the nerve to order another white one soon and fingers crossed that it will be symetrical.", "Awesome fit, long, just what I needed.Helps conceal my firearms as I have a longer torso and my normal shirts pop over my firearm.Quality is really really nice, should last a long time.Fits even better once washer.Neck is slightly larger (one star drop) but I did learn they have a premium version which corrects this.Anyways for the price these are amazing.", "I love these shirts. I ordered 3 of the olive drab color in size large ( I'm 6', 200lbs, athletic build). After reading some of the other reviews, the first thing I did was look for defects and check that they were all the same size. These are about as thick as a fruit of the loom under shirt (basic white tee) and you cannot see through them. At least in the color I bought. I normally buy the Bella + Canvas long body tee but wanted some color besides black, white, and grey. Comparing the two, these are shorter and thinner but you don't have to pull them up to sit down, they don't interfere with your movement. They cover your rear and fit really well.", "The quality completely depends on what color you get. White/Grey 100% cotton so even when washing on the coldest setting they will still shrink about half in size. Maroon/Dark grey is a softer polyester hybrid. Stays soft and doesn\u2019t shrink.

Well, just keep reading...I purchased three\u00a0PGA TOUR Golf Air Flux Short-Sleeve Solid Polo Shirt, Caviar, X-Large\u00a0and three\u00a0Hanes Men's X-Temp Performance Polo, Black, XX-Large\u00a0on the same day.  I did this because I wanted to compare the two shirts.Both fit well.  Both seem to be of good construction and quality fabric.There is, however, one major difference:  The PGA TOUR shirts have accumulated a STINK over the past few months. The 100% polyester PGA shirts now have \"an odor\" whereas the 90% cotton/10% polyester Hanes shirts do not.How am I doing laundry?  I throw them into the washing machine and then into the dryer.  Yes, I know, I've checked the internet and found out that I can de-stinkify polyester shirts through a simple process of soaking them for a few hours in a mixture of hot water, vinegar, and Listerine mouthwash.  It really does work...temporarily.  Thing is, I just want to do my laundry and not make an all-day affair out of it.CONCLUSION:  My experiment was a success.  I will purchase more of the Hanes and will NOT purchase any more of the PGAs.", "I read the reviews first and decided i would give it a try.I bought this product for my husband. These shirts are excellent, I only ordered one to see first what it was like,  the material is nice and soft (60% Cotton and 40% polyester). I washed it a few times and it hasn't faded or shrank, it still looks like new. I will definitely be ordering more in different colours for him. My husband loves it.It fitted as expected, I bought the blue, its a nice colour, added a picture for you to see. It does look like the picture they show.Very good quality for the money.The product came on time.", "This has become my new work shirt. We have to wear either black or white at work and with me being a bigger guy.....solid white just doesn't look great on me. The shirt breathes well in the summer. I live in SW Arizona and it consistently hits 108+ degrees in the summertime. So having a shirt that can breathe helps out a ton. I still sweat in it, but I can cool off quickly once indoors.The one thing I have noticed is that over time the shirt has become a duller black. Yes the shirt is black, but it's more of a dark black not pure black as when I first bought it. My only guess to that is because the dye is fading over the every other day washes.", "These polos are fantastic. They are soft, breathable, and wash and dry wonderfully. We have purchased two white and one black in the XXXL size and they have been washed an worn many times. Fit is consistent between colors and these are nice and long. The collar also does not curl up after drying and we haven't noticed any significant fading on the black polo after at least 12 washes with like colors. I don't feel like they shrunk at all either. We will be getting more of these in the future.", "First reaction: soft!Second reaction: kinda big!After reading the reviews complaining about it being \"too small\", I thought I'd play it safe and order a size up. I'm 5'11\", 180 lb (180 cm and 80 kg for everyone else in the world) and I'm on the thicker side-- I go to the gym 5 days a week, but I also eat ice cream 7 days a week, so I'm sure it adds up.I tried it on as soon as I got it and it's definitely on the larger side/fits like a \"regular large\" would fit on me. I own mostly medium shirts, so I know what a large feels like. It does feel on the longer side, but I expect it to shrink some since most of the reviews say that as well. I'm using this polo shirt as a Halloween costume, so I won't go through the simple (but still kind of arduous) process of returning and purchasing a better-fitting size.In my honest opinion, I don't think it makes me look fat, although a bit baggy at the armpit areas. I do adjust the bottom when reaching into my pockets, but that doesn't bother me very much. Since the shirt is so darn soft, I'll probably use it to sleep/lounge when I want to relax but also have a collar-- which, by the way, is definitely on the larger side for those of you that like a snug collar. Thankfully, the relaxed fit of the shirt sags the collar and doesn't make me look too much like a turtle.The material breathes okay, but nothing like Nike or other dedicated athletic wear. It'll probably get a little hot in the sun, but it won't be like wearing a trash bag. Overall, it seems like a solid shirt! If I need to buy another, I'll definitely come back, but I'll probably order my usual size instead of sizing up.", "These are not high quality polo shirts. They are basically an incognito Hanes X-Temp t-shirt disguised as a polo shirt. In the right environment, they're awesome! I bought one to check sizing and decided to watch the prices and buy more when the price fluctuates cheaper than usual. So far, I've bought the Neon Blue and the Neon Yellow. Both are bright, vibrant colors that pop.Sizing: I have (in actual tape measured inches) a 42 inch chest, 36 inch waist, and 14 inch unflexed  biceps. Mediums in this shirt fit me nicely.", "Way better than expected for price. Added logo for work shirt", "I bought these shirts in 4 different colors (black, navy, royal blue, and light steel) since I usually wear polos when I'm on-site for client visits.  Figured I'd give these a shot for some of the more casual offices.  For the price they are a great value.  I just wish the quality was a little higher.  On every single shirt I've had to tie off and cut the stitching under the arms.  I'm not sure if this is just excess stitching that comes loose after a few uses and washes, or what.  No holes have opened up, so I'm hoping that's the case.  It's just a bit worrisome when you've worn the shirt 5 times and have to cut foot long strings out of the armpit.But... they're cheap to replace and look good enough that it's not a big thing.  I'll probably buy some more when these get ragged.  On the good side they fit well and the fabric doesn't pill like some other shirts I've had.", "As I expected, this shirt went beyond my expectations. It has been worn and washed multiple times and it has retained its shape and color.  Often with other clothing with a red color, the color fades or bleeds. Not so with this shirt.  I have enjoyed wearing it and I receive compliments on it.  The fabric is soft which makes it comfortable to wear often.  It is casual and yet, it is dressy for going out. The sleeve length and the length of the shirt are perfect. The collar has a slight stiffness to enable it to retain its shape although it is extremely comfortable. The buttons are attached well and fit well in the button holes.Hanes has a reputation of manufacturing great products and it is evident in this product and others I have used. I highly recommend this shirt and this manufacturer.  I will definitely buy this brand again and I look forward to purchasing the variety of colors it comes in.  The product arrived quickly and in great condition.  I regularly purchase from Amazon because of the consistent products I can get.", "Large works fine for 44 inch chest!

These are great if you want a v-neck that stays hidden (the shirt is relatively wide V at the neck) under a dress shirt with the top button(s) unbuttoned. These are great if you want a v-neck that stays tucked in to the pants (the shirt is relatively long). These are great if you want a v-neck that fits relatively well as an undershirt (the shirt isn't tight but it is not a loose fit around the arms and torso). These are great if you want a v-neck that works well under short-sleeved shirts (the shirt has relatively short sleeves). Hope that helps...", "I bought these shirts in July; I now bought many more to fully replace my other well made T shirts. I said that these \"fit as expected\" because there is no \"fit entirely better than expected\" category. The manufacturer's claim of super-soft material and lack of coming untucked rang so true to me when I was reading the description for my re-order. They are so comfortable for both reasons. Again, I am replacing all my T shirts with these; my others are reasonable--hopefully someone will benefit via Goodwill--but these are just great as far as I am concerned. Note also that it takes a lot to motivate me to write a review. Parenthetically, I have benefitted greatly from Amazon reviews, so for anyone writing incisive comments, thank you.", "Based on the reviews, you\u2019d think white v-neck undershirts might be the most inconsistent product for sale here. Every time I go to reorder some, the model is no longer available and I have to go searching for another version. When I could not find a good Hanes ComfortSoft version to reorder, I tried this one, and I\u2019m glad I did! It\u2019s fitted in the chest and arms, which doesn\u2019t make you look like a dweeb with extra fabric hanging off. It\u2019s also long enough to comfortably tuck in without looking like a belly shirt after one wash. I\u2019m 5\u201910 and 180 lbs and the medium is perfect.", "Finally a shirt that fits my body shape - tall and lanky. I'm 6'1 and 155 pounds. Regular large size t shirts fit in length but are too baggy, and mediums fit in size but are not long enough. These fill both categories. Be careful washing on high heat though, some of mine have shrunk to the point that they are quite tight in my chest area, and just barely long enough to keep a button up shirt tucked in. Only negative is that the sleeves are very short, like almost a tank top. My armpit hair sticks out when just standing there, and I am not an overly hairy guy.

I ordered a Large and I'm 6'0 200lbs and it was long enough but rather tight in the body and arms. Arms were also slightly short, so I think the sizing is correct and they do not run large. It's an undershirt so could still wear it just rather uncomfortable for me. If you like your undershirts fitted maybe go a size down and I'm usually an XL.", "They are cheaper than the stores, which is great. They definitely shrink - and you should know this. This is nothing new - you need to know this before you order. Order a size bigger, they will shrink a whole size. Guaranteed. You should not be mad when this happens.The problem is when someone wants to wear them as a \"t-shirt\", and not as an undershirt. Because they will be always be too long - if you get the proper size - because they are supposed to be this way.", "I wear these under dress shirts and short sleeve button downs.Here is why I will keep buying these year after year.1. The cut of this V-Neck does not show when I leave the top button(s) unbuttoned on my dress and short sleeve button down shirts. This is a must for more casual use of my dress shirts.2. The length is long enough that this shirt tucks into my pants and does not come out when I raise my arms or reach down to tie my shoes. It's annoying when shirts come out of my pants and need adjusting. These are longer than normal and serve that purpose.3. These shirts are just the right thickness. They are not too thin that you can see through them and they are not too thick that they bunch or show that you are wearing an undershirt.4. Buffering layer: They are also just the right thickness and softness  to a) absorb sweat and b) buffer my skin from the outer shirt.5. Price: I'm very happy about the price for this six pack. Thank you!", "The shirt I received really are tagless and the fabric feels nice (for the price).My main issue is the size - I'm a 5\"11 man, rather slim but I wouldn't say skinny. I ordered a Small (the smallest size they carry) and the shirts might as well be dresses - they reach well below where by butt ends and the sleeves half way to my elbows. I feel like a little boy wearing his dad's clothes.In the picture you can see a side-by-side comparison of a Hanes small vs. one of these Fruit of the Loom small.So if you're an 8\" monster - congratulations, a size small would look great on you.I'll report back if there's any change after a few more cycles in the washer.", "I love these. I like them to fit pretty tight since i wear these under polos and dress shirts and i don't want them really baggy. I wear a Large in polos so i bought these in medium. They will shrink a little after you wash them the first time. They fit really tight over the shoulder and bicep and the sleeves are really short so you don't have to worry about them hanging out under your short sleeves either.! I now have a bunch of these. I currently have black, white, and grey. They are great quality at cheap price. They aren't super thick which i like since i'm wearing them under something else. Every one that i have received has been tagless. I saw some complaints of people getting ones with tags on them but none of the ones i order has had any tags.The one in the picture i have attached has been worn and washed at least 3 times. Hasn't faded at all and hasn't shrunk at all since the first wash."]},
{"asin": "B06XWQBJ6N", "comments": ["I am so sad to write a one star review for these - especially after recommending them to so many of my friends. I should have waited a few weeks before telling people that these were amazing.Firstly, the fabric and fit is outstanding. This is primarily why I told so many people they were great.I was looking to replace my American Eagle t-shirts that I had for about a year; and not because they had any holes or rips, but they were just starting to look run down. I had previously purchased Goodthreads button down shirts and was very happy with the quality, so I figured I\u2019d try their T-shirt\u2019s and bought one in each color.When they arrived, I was blown away. From the stretchy material (that wasn\u2019t too stretchy), to the modern fit - this was everything I wanted in a tee. Especially since I wear a lot of tee\u2019s under blazers for work. I liked them so much that a week later, I went and bought three more, per color!A few weeks later, my Goodthread tees from my first round of purchases started to come apart at the neck seams. It happened to one, so I thought it was random/a lemon. Then it happened to a second and third tee!For the price point (which is the same at American Eagle), these tees should be able to go 6 months to a year without seams failing. Unacceptable and I really feel like I wasted my money. Worst off, this puts a damper in my faith in the overall brand; if you can\u2019t get basics nailed down - why would consumers trust your more complicated apparel?I DO NOT recommend this product, unless you want throw-away/dispensable fashion.", "One of my white v-necks \u2013 which I had owned for years \u2013 was pilled at stained. When bleach could no longer guarantee me at least a stain-free shirt, I realized that it was time to replace it. I wanted something a bit more upscale than whatever Chinese mass manufacturer I had bought my previous shirt from, but I had a hard time justifying spending $20 for a shirt that is not much more complicated two pieces of cloth sewn together. This item from Goodthreads seemed to hit a sweet spot.PROS- Good material- Adequately assembled- The neckline does not swoop downThe tag says that the shirt is 100% cotton, but it is surprisingly stretchy. I do not recall my other shirts being quite so pliable, but I am not complaining. The fibers are smooth and the fabric breaths well, which is perfect for looking good even in blazing Hawaii weather. After the first wash, there were a couple loose strings, but the seams look to be of reasonable quality and I do not except them to unravel or for more strings to come apart.However, what I most appreciate about the shirt is that the neckline does not plunge downwards, which seems to be an increasingly popular style these days. I want to see my collar bones, not my chest hair. If you are looking for something more revealing, this is not your shirt.CONS- NoneI have nothing bad to say about this shirt yet.CONSIDERATIONS- Seems to run on the small side- Uncertain longevityThe one thing that you should note is that this shirt runs rather small. I ordered a medium, but it feels close to a small. I prefer a looser fit, so I think I might order a size up next time. However, if you enjoy tops that hug you a bit more, this is up your alley.The shirt was $12, so I am not expecting it to become a family heirloom. However, I am curious to know how well it will hold up as the washes accumulate. I will update this review as necessary, but \u2013 at the time of this writing \u2013 I would encourage anyone to buy it.", "I was very impressed with the quality of the fabric and construction.  It is far superior to a similar shirt I have bought many colors of at Nordstrom.  What impressed me even more is when I washed it today and it washed up FAR superior to the Nordstrom version, for about 60% the price... this is a BEST BUY in my book.  If you are concerned about the sizing, I would go a size up,,, it runs a touch on the small side, though I would say standard for a \"slim\" fit.  I'm 5'10\" and 155lbs... bought a small.  I like things a hair on the small side, not baggy.", "These are very good t-shirts. I wear a lot of suits and sport coats for work and I don't want a heavy t-shirt under my dress shirt. These have a little stretch to them and fit slightly snug which is about want I want. I've paid as much as $70 for a Sunspel t-shirt from England and these compare favorably to those in my opinion. They are soft and I like the high quality cotton.", "I'm looking for organic cotton shirts to knock around in on evenings and weekends. I thought this looked like a good deal for organic. The shirt fits fine through the chest and waist. Even the arm holes fit fit. Oddly, it feels tight and uncomfortable through the underarm, almost like it's sewn on up too high. The shoulders have an odd hump in the middle, too.I've only washed it once so I don't know how it wears.I'm 5'9\" and 175 lbs.", "After reading reviews that these shirts are slim fight I went one size up and it fits perfect.

I called Amazon to return it, and then noticed the same exact spots separating on the other two I'd bought. So 3 out of 3 with the same problem: threads unraveling, collar separating from the shirt. Clearly a manufacturing problem, and I see other reviews with the same problem.

It really seems like it was made by a different company that sewed the Comfort Colors tag on.

I'm female, but I prefer mens-fit T-shirts, so I'm fairly used to the sizing. I  think it's at least a size bigger than normal mens T-shirt sizing.

It was not just this one shirt either as I have purchased others and the same thing.  And the collar gets stretched out more from wearing and washing.

I go to sites that sell shirts like this for $30-$50 just for this kind of quality. The softness from the polyester and cotton blend is what makes this shirt worth it. I just had to get rid of all my 100% cotton shirts because they felt too rough after I started wearing these. Not even my favorite brand store have this type of quality. I at least expected Hollister or Abercrombie to match this but even if they do They charge 3 times the price (on clearance too). I recommend this shirt brand too everyone. Just make sure to get 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The blend makes a huge difference. Not 50/50, Not 70/30, a true 60/40 is the one you want. Oh I almost forgot they even gave me a discount off my next purchase and I just started buying from them. Well Guess I'll starting buying from them now. See ya Later everyone.Edit 1. Where Do I even start. I was once so proud to be a customer for this seller but now I don't know what I'm getting. I just placed an order for the exact same shirt (size, color, and quantity). I was sure they would just send another shirt my way and I just pay for it like I regularly do on Amazon. I was glad to have been able to receive a quality shirt at first but now I just received something I can't even tell. They sent me not a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt but a Shaka Active shirt which is 100% cotton. The difference in the blend is very big too me. I like my 60/40 blend because of how soft the fabric is and how much more comfort I get wearing it. The brand Dream USA makes wonderful quality shirts and I admire their products. But for the Shaka Active shirt I receive was awful. Smells strange, and I don't even know why they sent me such a hippo-size shirt. I ordered a small. fabric was rough and poorly made; nothing compare to the 60% cotton / 40% polyester one I order 2 days ago. I just don't understand why they sent me this. Was it a mistake or a mix-up? Or perhaps they are trying to get rid of past inventory of Shaka Active shirts? All I want right now is just a replacement. I'll even take a different color (size: small [60% cotton / 40% polyester]).  I will buy again only if they truly do have a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt. I do not want to buy any more lies. Please I really want to buy more shirts. Here are some photos, The shirts may look alike but the texture is very different. First set is Shaka (100%) and Second set is A Real Dream USA shirt (60% cotton / 40% polyester) I'm repeating this a lot is because I do not want anymore 100% cotton shirts.Edit 2: Okay Okay You got me. So, as I was writing this review, it turns out they listen to me then sent me a replacement on the same day. I got my new shirt and it was a Dream USA shirt. I am confident now to start buying again. I just hope this does not happen again. I am also sorry to have said anything negative. You guys working in customer service, delivery, and manufacturing have done a wonderful job. I am more than satisfied and will be buying more shirts. In fact I'll be buying 2 more shirts right now. Thank you so much for your hard work.", "It's always hard to guess how a shirt will fit when you buy online but I personal love this shirt. I'm 6'2, 190lbs, and I went with the XL size and it fit just how hoped the slim fit would! I have not washed it yet and hope it does not shrink otherwise it could be too small.

Basically, there\u2019s two different manufacturers and fabrics of the shirts offered here. Color dictates whether it\u2019s a Dream shirt or Shaka shirt.

{"asin": "B01EU5CY6S", "comments": ["HALLELUJAH!I have been searching for years for a form fitting plain t-shirt, and I think I've found it. I have read hundreds of reviews where no one bothers putting their measurements, which I find absolutely useless for anyone else, so hopefully my review helps some of you. I was skeptical at first, just like every other time I've purchased a cheap t-shirt online (too short, too slim, too blocky, too wide, uncomfortable material), but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shirt on.I am 6'4\", 215-225 lbs and fit, so length and slimness is important to me. I bought an XL, and the length is incredible (if maybe not slightly long for some, but probably perfect after a wash). Not too often you get an XL with a cheap shirt and they keep it slim fitting rather than extending the width 15 inches assuming you're only going up a size because you're 300lbs. It fits the shoulders great. The XL extends to the ends of my shoulders ALMOST perfectly (sorry, don't have exact measurements to help here). As for the sleeves, another bonus! We all have hatred for flared sleeves and they feel like they're inevitable in cheap t-shirts. I have around 15\" cold biceps for reference and they hug the biceps all the way through without being too tight. They extend not too far past the halfway point in the bicep which I prefer (picture is accurate). Lastly, the material is very comfortable. The pictures were a bit deceiving when I was trying to guess how the material would feel but I can say my expectations were surpassed.Hopefully this helps out fellow brothers my size. I know this is the type of review I would try to scour for before purchasing, but with little success.", "I love these shirts. At one point, i had about 40 of them and 20 white shirts too. Amazing. I have only had 2 that had bad stitching, but a bad trip to the laundromat could have caused that. I will never wear another shirt.However, they are pretty long and the sleeves are pretty small. The overall fit is great. But an inch shorter on the length would be great and maybe about a quarter inch around the sleeves too for that absolutely perfect fit. If you're husky at all, don't bother. You wont like them even in the larger versions.", "****************IT'S BEEN A YEAR!**I've been blessed to basically live in these shirts for over a year now. I've never had a relationship like this with a t shirt... i now know for sure that it is love. My baby is 15 months old and I've managed to lose 15 lbs, so the shirts were getting a little loose. I'm cheap. And I'm resourceful. I took in an inch on the sides of these suckers and they're as good as new(ish).*****************My husband fell in love with this brand after he wore one from a local gym. He took note of the brand and then started searching the internet for it. Luckily he found it on Amazon. He knew to go up a size so it would fit better. He bought one, and then two more. And then three more. They are really soft and are a good fit (remember to go up a size).Another thing he really likes about it is that they are long enough (but not crazy long) to cover his concealed carry when he carries on his belt. He also likes the sleeve length, because as he proudly puts it, \"they show off my biceps\"This is a little embarrassing, but I started liking his shirts... so I made him buy me one. And now I think I have four. No, I have five. They are just really comfortable. It's not like I'm dressing up for my toddlers, so I wear them all the time. And to Wal-Mart. Because they're actually one of the nicest plain t-shirts I've ever worn. Comfortable enough to wear to bed as well. And, yeah, I'll just say it, not all t-shirts are great for breastfeeding with, but these are great. They aren't stiff; they have enough give, but also keep their shape.These are our favorite t-shirts and we'll probably keep ordering them and end up wearing them as senior citizens, and possibly request to be buried in them because, hey, they're really comfortable.", "The perfect fit, the perfect fabric, the perfect selection. We got them in every color and we don't regret it. If you've got a long torso and a particular need for softness, this is the shirt for you. The neon green/yellow is great for public events with a crowd.", "So far I\u2019ve purchased six different kinds of white T-shirts and this one is the most soft.It is kind of see-through which is what I\u2019m trying to avoid, hence why I\u2019d buy six different kinds of white T-shirts, but it is probably the best out of all of them.It\u2019s probably the least see-through out of all of them.It seems to be good quality, too.So if you\u2019re reading these reviews looking for softness, get it.If you\u2019re looking for a 100% non see-through white shirt, this isn\u2019t exactly the one but try it if you want. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it for how soft it is.", "I love these shirts. I don't know why it's so hard to find a well-made, good fitting t-shirt that isn't $30, but it is (for me at least). I don't want to spend more than $10 on a t-shirt, and even that's kind of pushing it. These shirts are made of good fabric, not too thick but not that sheer flimsy fabric that stretches out so easily. The colors are good (though to be fair I've only bought heather gray and black so far), the sleeves are good (not too short like those awful babydoll tees but not down to my elbows either) the length is perfect (I hate shirts that hit right at my hips, these are longer and hit about mid-bum on me. But they're also not so crazy long that it's awkward).I like a shirt that isn't super tight-fitting, but isn't hanging off me either. I got a size medium, and my measurements are somewhere around 32-27-36.", "I'm 5'7\", have a muscular build, weigh about 168lbs. This shirt is very soft and it didn't overtly shrink in the wash/dryer. It's a great fit. I plan to buy more now that I know the cut is nice. The sleeves aren't too long and there's plenty of room in the chest and lat areas so you don't feel constricted but it's still form fitting. Awesome shirts.", "This isn't just an underwear, u can wear it as a t,shirt to party,great quality low price is the best definition for it i love.abt to get four more in different colors", "As other reviewers mentioned, absolutely wonderful t-shirts.  No logos, no BS, super comfy, stylish.  I'm 6'2, 270lbs, I work out but not crazy.  I bought the 3XL size.  I bought one, got it, tried it on, and went back immediately and bought 10 more in different colors.I wear them all the time, casual with jeans, dress up with slacks, although I find their colors don't really suit active wear.  I mean, they are comfortable but look a bit out of place for active wear.  Maybe because they are just plain shirts, no logos or anything, and active wear I guess is suppose to be moving billboards...but yes, I wear them at the gym because I really don't care and they are just so super soft comfy.", "I got a same-style Next Level tshirt when friends did custom shirts on a fundraiser site. It's one of my favorite shirts, partly because of the design on the front but even more for the fit. I searched and even called Next Level to make sure that this short is the same type I already have.I normally wear a medium shirt but have XL in this and think it's perfect. This new shirt fits well and is a bit longer but I'm guessing it'll shrink more over time (as my other one did) and still be long enough. The scarlet is much more muted than in the picture- more of a heathered red/maroon. Very pretty. Though the sizing is a bit off I really like this shirt because it has that feminine fit, is soft and well made. It's not too thick but definitely not thin like so many shirts these days.Next Level has some v-neck tshirts on Amazon as well and they said that as long as I make sure it's the poly/cotton blend like this shirt, it'll be the same fit."]},

The material is the same for either style, just slightly weighty, but not in a heavy, sweaty non-desirable way. Just right for any climate.I also believe these are a tremendous value to the the quality of the cotton. They very closely remind me of what had been my go-to brand of t-shirts, Territory Ahead.

Their t-shirts are so iconic they've kept the quality up, but they are priced at 3X of these newly discovered Comfort Colors.This shirt is a friend with many benefits.

Comfort - The premium cotton is nice, light, and soft.  It's not heavy and bulky that you can't wear underneath other shirts but thick enough that you can wear it by itself.  I've worn it to work with jeans.  Being tagless also helps in comfort and the sleeve cuffs are hemmed smooth (more comfortable than the crew style IMO).

These Hanes beefy tees are quite durable. I have purchased many other brand name tees before, but these are in my opinion the best. The biggest issue with most other brands is that they usually don't retain their shape well, with some parts (especially the collar) stretching more than others after multiple washes. I find that these Hanes beefy tees overall has the best resilience to nonuniform stretch. Like most guys, I typically stick to the same product once I've found the right one, so I will keep buying these as long as they keep making them.", "First I love Beefy-T shirts.  They are made of good, quality cotton, which means they are durable.Pros:-Good quality cotton-Keep their shape and do not stretch out like other tees that I have purchased-Very little shrinkage, after a lot of washing, though I typically dry them on low heat or line dry themCons:-I am 6'2\" and bought the tall as I like to keep my tees tucked into my trousers/pants.  These are the perfect length for this.  However, I feel the sleeves are too long to wear under other short-sleaved shirts and have had to hem the sleeves so that they do not stick out of my other short-sleeved shirts.Overall, I am VERY happy with these and would purchase them again.  The tees I am comparing these with are the Hanes Premium, which are softer, but easily loose their shape and always ended up shrinking so that they did not keep their length.", "So sick and tired of corporations destroying the quality of their product to save a few cents. I ordered \"beefy Ts\" from Hanes own website and had to return them because they bore no resemblance to the beefy tees I've been buying for the past several years. Shirts were thinner and fit was wrong. Men want substance in our clothes. We don't want lingerie. If Hanes wants to make a drastic change to their product they should market it under a different name. \"Frilly Ts\" might work. When will these corporations learn that loyal buyers would prefer to pay an extra buck for something they're satisfied with rather than be driven away by some recently minted Masters Degree graduate's bright idea of how to save 5 cents per unit?

{"asin": "B07F1718XQ", "comments": ["As someone who's pushing 6'3\" and 175lbs (most of that being around the mid-region), I was really debating between getting this shirt in large or the regular/loose fit in a medium. So I got both! And if I'm being honest, there wasn't very much of a difference. While this shirt in a medium (which I also bought) did feel tight, the large met with my broad shoulders perfectly and didn't get too slim as it went down along my chest and stomach (though the advertising photo makes it look like it totally just becomes a \"V\" towards the crotch). The regular-fit medium had a very similar fit, but was about a half inch shorter in vertical length and an inch shorter across the shoulders. Though it didn't slim as it went down like the slim-fit large, it's already shorter width made it feel like a tighter fit. Weird, right?? I tried on both shirts again and again, both before and after a single wash/dry, trying to point out all the differences before I came here to write about it here. All in all, I'm probably going to keep the slim-fit large as it actually has the shoulder length I like while not staying that length all the way down and giving off a total box-y fit. The slim-fit medium was just too small and the regular-fit medium was just a little too narrow, though I believe a regular-fit large would probably be too wide. One complaint of all the shirts that I'll have is that after a wash/dry, the hems at the bottom of the shirt did begin to curl up a bit, which is disappointing because it looks cheap (which I know it is, but other people don't).

The 14/16 I ordered this time is same size as size smaller I ordered last time.  I kept it because my child loves tie dye and it fits him now.  but this 14-16 is being worn by an 8 yr old who normally wears an 8/10 and weighs 69 lbs.

This info provided for those that are tall(large and not heavy). Also the shirts are tagged \"Heavy Cotton\" but are not of a heavy density. They are much lighter cotton that other providers I have obtained from in the past. Still I think they will last for some time, for they seem to be quality made. Also they do not bleed in wash. I preformed the wash in a cold/cold cycle, which also prevented any shrinkage. I normally find a XXL a little snug. Thus the reasoning behind ordering XXXL. Figuring that would suffice and guarantee me a good fit. Bottom line when ordering be sure to increase sizing.", "I have a 10-year-old daughter who grows like a weed.

The only problem I faced with it is that even though the tag says to machine wash on cold, I still notice that I'm getting blue dye over my neck and torso, even though I washed it before use. Using baking soda in the shower takes the dye off for the most part, but I washed the shirt in hot water in hopes that it would prevent it from happening in the future!", "Cheap and not worth money.

It is extremely clear that somewhere along the way, someone messed up. I ordered this pack of two shirts. 1/2 shirts fit as expected and met my expectations for a basic v neck. The second shirt however was the craziest thing I have ever seen. A complete hodgepodge of material slapped with a Hanes label and sent to my mailbox. The torso portion of the shirt was the same as the other. The sleeves...well, not only were they beyond short (app. 5.5\"), but they were a completely different material from the torso all together. They are made of a stretchy poly material.  This is the most Frankenstein shirt. I am baffled that it managed to make its way through so many hands to actually make it to me, the consumer. It really makes one wonder about the quality control, or lack thereof. Extremely disappointed.", "They pull slightly around the armpits and shoulders, so feel a little small, even though they are the same size as some older Hanes crew neck t-shirts I have that feel much more comfortable.Also the v-neck is high (tight near the front of the neck) and therefore shows when wearing a shirt over it (with the top button opened) which was how I intended to use them. That was the reason I purchased the v-neck (so it wouldn't show), so pretty much a waste of money for me.3/4/17 Update: I purchased these T's to wear under a shirt in winter. The new \"Nano\" cotton Hanes T's compared to the older non-Nano Hanes T's I had, act almost like velcro. Putting a shirt on over these newer T's is a trial at best. The T shirt material wants to cling to my outer shirt fabric. Pullover type shirts are the most difficult to get both shirts lined up and feeling comfortable together. My non-Nano Hanes T's are soft enough and don't cling. They end up actually being the more comfortable of the two to wear with another shirt over them.", "High quality V neck shirts, I wear these as regular shirts. I am 5'8 170 pounds. I bought a size large, the fit is comfortable, I like the fabric, very comfortable and feels great. My only issue with the shirts is they are long. I have washed mine 3 times now, they did shrink a tad bit, but nothing drastic or out of the norm. I read reviews here that said these shirts shrink drastically, that was not the case for me. Will be trying a size medium, as I like the fit of the large, but if it was a tad bit smaller it would be perfect.", "Bought the XXL. I have an 18in neck which, for the size of the shirt, isn't really thick. When I put it on, the \"V\" almost straightens out into a regular crewneck shape.

I really couldn't believe that became a fad (and still kind of is)... I was honestly befuddled that people were buying paper thin elastic shirts and paying DOUBLE for them at that.  They looked like complete crap and were intentionally cheap... The only way those looked good was if you had a perfect ripped body and even then it was like, well, dude is cut but looks like a wanna be Cali boy...  Point I'm making here is that these are a nice throw back to a regular t-shirt, yes, they may shrink a tad in the laundry (hence the minus one star on my rating) BUT you can stretch them right back out easily enough, not to mention they look like a t-shirt SHOULD look...  they also make decent undershirts for the times you want to leave your over shirt unbuttoned.

Apparently it was uncomfortable enough for him to rip it out midday at work.Construction is good, shirts are not soft, though. I'm happy with their quality and suspect they'd last a long time.

It was ridiculously huge, it looked like he had lost 100lbs but didn't bother to buy new tshirts. Even if it shrank a ton in the wash it still would have been too big. So I returned the xl and washed the large how I wash all our clothing, with cold water and dry on delicate, and it came out maybe just a tiny bit smaller (though it was such a minuscule change, I could have very well imagined it just due to expecting it to shrink) but that is how it goes for most clothing and was not unexpected.It is heavier weight than say a 6 pack of hanes tshirts, but not quite as thick as other heavyweight tees we've tried.

{"asin": "B000A2BIS6", "comments": ["I purchased two colors (Navy Blue and Grey) of the Dickies Men's 2-Pack Short-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirts (Size XL).  Since I purchased a few 1-packs of the Dickies Men's Heavyweight Crew Neck Short Sleeve Tees\u00a0Dickies Men's Heavyweight Crew Neck Short Sleeve Tee, Dark Navy, X-Large\u00a0from Amazon a couple of months back, I assumed these were the same.  They are not. Let me first say that these were both fine shirts, but with differences that might matter to you.  I am giving these 2-pack shirts a 2 star rating, because they are not to my liking and I will explain why.The first noticeable difference is the country of origin.  The 1-pack shirts I originally purchased were made in Nicaragua, the 2-pack shirts were made in Pakistan.  This probably explains the other more meaningful differences in the shirts I found.I did not like these 2-pack shirts from Pakistan because they were smaller, softer (you may want that!), thinner and lighter than the 1-pack shirts from Nicaragua. I really hate the soft, thin, light, stretchy t-shirts that seem to be the norm today.Details and data:I measured the eight shirts I had available, four 1-pack shirts from Nicaragua and four 2-pack shirts from Pakistan.  I first laid the shirts out on a bed and measured across at about mid-waist, which is where I noticed the difference in fit.  Then, I weighed each shirt on a food scale.  Finally, I measured the thickness of the shirts near the collar by doubling the material and using my digital calipers.  I measured this area three times and took the average.Measurement at Mid waist:  The 1-pack shirts fit me perfectly, leaving room all around, but not too much.  The four 1-pack shirts measured at 25 \u00bd, 25 \u00bd, 25 \u00bd, and 25 inches.  The four 2-pack shirts measured at 24 \u00be, 24, 24, and 23 \u00be inches.  No wonder they felt tighter. I could probably keep the one shirt at 24 \u00be, but since it\u2019s a 2-pack, that won\u2019t work.  The 1-pack shirts are more consistent in size, they are larger and the total variation was pretty amazing. This is a difference you can feel.Weight: The four 1-pack shirts measured at 10.15, 9.95, 9.4 and 9.55 oz.  The four 2-pack shirts measured at 8.3, 8.2, 8.6 and 8.45 oz.  The 1-pack shirts averaged 9.76 oz. and the 2-pack shirts averaged 8.39 oz.  So the 1-pack shirts averaged 16% heavier than the 2-pack shirts. This is a difference you can feel.Thickness: The four 1-pack shirts measured at 1.18, 1.22, 1.19 and 1.18 mm. The four 2-pack shirts measured at 1.08, 1.06, 1.08, and 1.07 mm.  The 1-pack shirts averaged 1.19 mm altogether and the 2-pack shirts averaged 1.07 mm altogether.  So the 1-pack shirts averaged 11% thicker than the 2-pack shirts. This is a difference you can feel.These 2-pack shirts were not bad, but in comparison to the 1-pack shirts, for the things that matter to me, they fell behind.  Since there is a big difference between these shirts, it would be nice if the country of origin was part of the description and that one would know which shirt they are getting when placing the order on Amazon.", "My husband only liked to wear Stafford white tees because they made them a thick cotton.

These were what I would  call a true large, and just what I wanted. The fabric is about medium weight, and looks like it will be durable. The construction is good, and the color was a nice sand (desert) beige, a bit darker than it shows on the computer, but attractive. The fit and feel is very comfortable, which is why I ordered more immediately.

They fit well without being too tight.  The sleeves are the perfect length, fitting closely at mid-bicep.  The material is durable, soft, and comfortable.  The shirts are cheap enough to be bought in bunches and tossed into the rag pile when I get bike grease on them or they are ruined by residual bleach from my neighbor's last load of laundry.  They work as an undershirt but look good enough to be worn on their own, which is how I wear them 99% of the time.  Overall, they are an outstanding purchase.The only complaint I have about them is that they tend to take on and hold wrinkles when I wash and dry them, even if I remove and fold them right away.  They are cotton, so this isn't a huge surprise, but in some colors, such as gray, the wrinkles can really stand out.  And it does seem to me that they wrinkle more than other 100% cotton shirts, perhaps because of the softness and light weight of the fabric.  These went out of stock for a while in black, causing me to try Next Level's blended fabric fitted t-shirts.  They fit even better, are just as comfortable, and wrinkle substantially less.  They have become my new standard t-shirt.If you are considering these, you should go ahead and buy them, or buy the blended fabric version.  You won't be sorry.

This one in particular in color \"natural\" is see through and way too long for someone who is tall.  Since each one fits differently and has a different length (although I purchased all in the same size) really you never know what you're going to get.  Although this is not as pictured the seller requires that the buyer pay return shipping for their defective items.

This one is indeed fitted, and it's true to size after one washing. It does shrink just a tad after that first washing, which Next Level accounts for in its sizing. So what you get is a perfect, true-to-size, flattering fit after one preemptive washing. The slight shrink after that one washing has 100% to do with the 100% Cotton content. Accept no unnatural and man-made substitutes unless you have to, and in this case, you don't.Unless it's a tank - which can be a sketchy fashion decision - monotone t-shirts are as versatile as jeans, they're never going out of style (i.e., they're never going to look bad in photos twenty years from now), and the $7-ish price on these is akin to theft.

The texture is pretty smooth to the touch, with a very slight sueded feel. The fabric has a bit of stretch to it, but not too much.After washing, it didn't shrink, and so far has kept its shape.

As expected, I absolutely love it, as it hugs my figure in all the right places: arms, chest, upper back/trap area. I'm 6ft 155lbs of lean muscles, and Next Level Mens products really accentuate my body in a way that other products have failed to (I wish I was getting paid to write this nicely about them :D ).The only reason I put \"somewhat small\" is that the sleeves initially hugged my arms a little more than what I had grown accustomed to. However, I soon learned to appreciate its ingenious design to accentuate my muscles. If you are insecure about your body (skinny or fat) and would like the sleeves to have extra room, this design might not be for you. But if you'd like to show off all the hours you spent in the gym and the kitchen like me, you would absolutely love this line of shirts."]},

I ordered a medium which almost always fits me well. The chest is a bit too tight and there is a weird gapping at the back of the shoulders, which makes it look loose at the back of the shoulders and sloppy from behind.

I am almost too ashamed to give them to Goodwill- Maybe there is a guy who wears a medium and likes LIGHT WEIGHT tees, maybe even thinks it's fashionable to have ripped out seams. BTW,  I bought one green beefy tee at the same time, from a different supplier at the regular price, and it was just as good as all the other beefy tees.", "The 3 stars may be the result of inattention on my part. I figured \"Beefy Tee\" meant heavier fabric (which it has) but not \"relaxed fit\". It is also the latter, especially in the armpit area.

They also look better than the thin tee's. When I am working they retain the sweat so that I stay cooler in warm temperatures. Their thickness also is nice on cold days so that I'm warm with out a lot of layers, but yet can add another shirt that keeps me comfortable and warmer, better than some options because it is layered against cold and heat.

The thing is that every beefy t I got fit awkwardly around the shoulders, as if the fabric was just bunching up and looked like my t shirt was a size too small.

I am 5'6\" weight 195, muscular build, 16+\" biceps 46\" chest and doesn't feel restricted at all, so if you have more a muscular build this is a very nice shirt to emphasize your physique because the sleeves sit higher up on the biceps..

I personally think this is a plus, and I have no problem with it. The shirts actually seem of really high quality compared to others I've purchased. My favorite thing about them is, because of the stretchy fibers, when I roll my sleeves up, they stay rolled up, instead of deforming like pure cotton sleeves often do, and rolling back down my arms. I've washed them a few times and have yet to see an shrinkage. As an aside, I personally don't like the extra buttons on the right side, and I was able to cut them off easily without ruining any other stitches.One thing of note: when I purchased the tan and brown shirts, the colors were way off, and not in a good way.

They are purely decorative.  To be fair, that's in the description but it looks silly and on top of there are 2 more buttons sewn onto the collar. YEs, the collar. and it looks very weird and unnaturally placed with no oppoosing button holes. I'm returning this thing."]},

I got this as it\u2019s economical and looks very cool.  My son tried them on and we almost had to return it. If you look closely where there is a difference in color, like the chest and sides , those all have seams. It was too scratchy for my son. Thankfully I was able to convince him to keep and wear them.

Obviously, use the same color shirt for both experiments.Compared to fit vs the Hanes' Beefy T, the Hanes' shirt is slightly more comfortable.

Seem well made.CONS:  These T-Shirts certainly are not a true XL.  Both that have arrived so far are consistent in size, but when laid over a true XL T-Shirt that has been washed many times, they are about 1-1/2 Inches narrower across the shoulder seam and over an inch narrower at the armpit seam.  They compare closely with several Large size T-Shirts I own. These comparisons were made after only one cold washing of the new T-Shirts, so I anticipate further shrinking.  The shirts to which they were compared have been washed many times. These T-Shirts were not as heavy weight as I had anticipated, too.CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: I have been wearing Gildan tank tops in Large Size for many years now and have found them to be pretty much run true to size from multiple orders over several years.  Thusly, I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the sizing of these T-Shirts but will find use for them as outside work shirts.  I prefer loose fitting, heavy weight T-Shirts for inside, comfort wear, and I will have to look elsewhere.  Also, as mentioned above, I had hoped that the advertised weight of the cotton material would run to the heavy side but also considered that finding a nice, heavy weight T-Shirt might be a trial and error process.  All in all, these seem to be decent T-Shirts, but I would not recommend them based on size alone.", "I am so disappointed in the material of these shirts.

If you're washing this shirt. don't let the wet garment sit in machine, and maybe avoid using Oxiclean or detergents with Oxiclean.  I recommend the manufacturer replace these metal buttons with khaki green plastic ones, or a more corrosion resistant metal.

You'll think they're so great, in fact, that you'll probably order another 10-15 in various colors just to have around.Unfortunately, after washing them 1-3 times, they've become unwearable for me. They shrink somewhat noticeably (it's not insane, but they became tight enough that I don't want to wear them anymore), and they ride up like crazy around your back. I'm not sure how, but if I'm sitting or lying down, or even biking, I'll need to adjust the shirt every at least 10-20 minutes because it will have managed to fold up 2-3 times around my waist. This might have something to do with the fit (though I doubt that's the only issue), but it makes these pretty much unwearable for me unless I know I'm going to be standing or walking around all day.I also dislike the arms on these - they flare out like crazy, and I don't think it could possibly look good unless you've got really big biceps (I don't). Personally, I didn't notice this until I got another shirt to compare it to, but it really sticks out to me now (and not in a good way). A few of them have also had long threads start coming out (especially around the sleeves), though this doesn't bother me as much.I've recently started switching to Next Level shirts and they're amazing in comparison - they're noticeably softer, the sleeves are much better fitting and they never ride up.

They're thin enough you can see shadows of chest hair, nipple, or undergarment if you look closely.They wick away moisture REALLY well and are comfortable by themselves between 45F and 75F (6'6\" or 197gm, and 266LBS or 125kg).From 34F to 45F, these are fine as an undershirt with a thin jersey or jacket over the top, though at 34F, it's a little chilly until I'm warmed up.They don't block any wind, so if you're not pushing hard enough to huff and puff, move your temperatures up a bit.Fabric is durable, as is the stitching.  They are inexpensive shirts, and I like that.  If I tear it on something, no big deal.I've sent a few of these through the wash several times, and I always run them through the dryer on low-heat + very-dry.  The fabric has suffered no shrinkage, embrittlement, etc.These are the same shirts that some of the local print shops sell for 5x with a single-side print.If you run such a print shop, the price here seemed to be lower than what some local wholesalers had.If you are an end-consumer and don't need prints, or have your own dye-sub shirt printer, these are cost effective.Know that when I bought them, shipping for one was the same as shipping for 10.

He finds them extremely comfortable and fit true to size. That being said, I'm not fond of how they come out of the wash. They go in with no stains and come out covered in them unless I use a gentle cycle with pretty much just these types of shirts together. They cannot have fabric softener used on them either. The first few days he had them the seams had loose threads. This is something I can fix but don't want to worry about in a brand new shirt. Just some things to keep in mind when purchasing. They aren't awful, just a little more work to care for and with 5 kids, not something I prefer.", "I now own three of these shirts in various colors. I'm a road cyclist and I bought them mostly for use as athletic wear. They provide better protection from the sun than short-sleeved jerseys and probably keep me cooler on hot summer days too. On the hottest days I'll \"prime the pump\" by dampening the fabric covering my arms and chest before I start the ride. The shirt feels comfortable and cool as the breeze evaporates the moisture. On cool days these shirts work as a windbreaker and help keep one warm.

Just biked 20 miles in cool weather. This shirt, unlike my normal shirts, stopped most of the cooler air from coming through.

I decided to do some searching on the internet to see if I could find a better option for my wallet. Boy am I glad I did! I'm 6' 0\" 185lb and in 99% of shirts I'm a medium in the torso, but a large across the shoulders and arm length-- so I ordered one of both sizes. Luckily I only had to open the medium because it fit me perfect. Very comparable size-fit to the Huk long sleeve that I was considering spending almost 4x the money on. With the savings I'll either buy 3 more colors of the A4 or more fishing gear to use while I'm wearing this shirt this summer. It's tagless, lightweight, breathable, and the seams 'seem' to be of good quality. The only noticeable difference between this and the Huk is the Huk's 10% spandex that makes it a stretchier fabric. That and the free advertisement Huk gets by you wearing their big logo on your chest, back, and sleeves. Six/five stars exactly what I was looking for at a fraction of the price I thought I'd have to pay."]},

I decided to get the orange version which was really vibrant in color and the material was surprisingly thick considering a lot shirts made in Asia tend to be on the thinner fabric side.One thing I want to echo from other reviewers is that this shirt (unlike other polo shirts you would order from Korea or China) runs loose like they do typically in American or European made brands. This means that you don't need to order 2 sizes larger as some folks are recommending. I'm 5'6\" 135 lbs and the US S (Asia L) was actually loose on me. So I had to return it and get a US XS (Asia M) for the slim fit appearance.

I found that other cotton shirts from Gildan were too scratchy, a little oversized/blocky, and the colors were too bright for my liking. The heathering lends to a more muted color that I prefer. I think the fiber blend of cotton/poly adds to the softness of the material, making the shirts comfortable to sleep in. Note that the mixed fibers won't shrink so much, but I think they got the sizing just right on these shirts -- a little more fitted than other Gildan shirts, by design.I think I'll experiment and buy some earth tones of the 100% cotton Softstyle Ringspun shirts to see if they are just as soft as the fiber blended ones.", "I have quite a few Gildan Softstyle Dark Heather shirts that fit great.

The size was as expected; however, the black is not jet black, which was apparent even after one washing in only cold water. It is also on the thinner side. If you are looking for something as a layering item, something to throw on for the gym, or similar, it as very adequate for that purpose and is priced fairly for that use.I personally would not wear it for other than outdoor chores, working around the house, sleeping on a cold night, or the gym. Your mileage may vary. If the colour had held better, I'd give it another star. While thinner, it has held up well fabric-wise, as well as the stitching.", "I ordered the Oxford grey. It is NOT 100% cotton. It is 10% polyester, so it didn't shrink much when washed and tumble dried. I buy 100% cotton shirts one size bigger because they always shrink in the clothes dryer (especially the sleeve length), regardless of whether it \"preshrunk\" by the factory. The seller needs to correct the information for this item to show that it is NOT 100% cotton. If some colors are 100% cotton and other are not, then the seller needs to clarify this in the product information.", "I bought 2 of these, one cardinal red and one olive green.  Colors are fairly representative as advertised.  Great price but material is thinner than I had hoped.  Won't provide much for warmth but would be a nice layer to an outfit.  I am 5\" 8\" and fluctuate between 210-220 pounds with the extra weight being around the mid-section.  Size is everything and buying clothes online has always been a challenge for me.  All in all, this is a nice long sleeve shirt if you can match a size to your body.  The XL fit is close for me but probably better suited more as an undershirt for layering purposes but a bit too tight for wearing on it's own on my size frame.  An XXL would most likely hang too long on me and perhaps a bit too loose but would be OK for something to sleep in.  Since I am not with the perfect body, the trick for me is finding the fit for the purpose.", "Good fit. Looks just like the product photo. Maybe slightly darker.  My issue with it is I bought this due to the product description advertising it as being 100% cotton...it's not.  The tag says 50% cotton/50% polyester and it feels like it.  It is still a good shirt for the price, just don't expect 100% cotton.", "It's pretty light in the collar department. I think(?) most men, me at least, judge a T Shirt by it's collar. Whimpy collar, thin collar, collar that doesn't keep it's shape etc, that's a bad shirt. Thick collar, beefy collar etc, that's what manley men want on their T Shirts. This shirt's collar is not the whimpiest I've seen but it's just not up to the Fruits and others. Colors good, collars bad.", "I'm not sure how these 100% cotton T shirts came to be so rough but they feel like 120 grit sandpaper right out of the bag. I would return them if it weren't for the hassle and the fact that they are a low priced item. I purchased a multi pack Fruit Of The Loom short sleeve T's this summer and they were perfect. I should have taken note and purchased their long sleeve version. I have never felt 100% cotton that had this rough texture, hopefully they will improve with some washing's, if not I will donate them to a shelter. Cannot recommend this product and read no comments to the quality of this 100% cotton that were negative.After washing cold and drying hot the material of this shirt softened substantially.", "Horrible material, I washed it multiple times, soaked it in Downy and it stayed like thin sack cloth.  I wore it and the material is uncomfortable and the rim on the inside of the neck was an irritant to my neck.  This is pretty much the same crap material that is sold on the internet to people who are looking for a 'soft' comfortable shirt.  While the name \"MJ Soffe\" is an old name, it, in my opinion, gives one to believe it is 'soft'.....NOT&gt;&gt;I won't even donate this over priced rag to a thrift store.", "I bought two of these T-Shirts having my reservations on the quality verses the price. I was surprised that they were a great fit but waited to post my review until after I washed them. Surprise again, not much shrinkage at all after a few washings.I really like the fit around the neck and the length is much longer than the \"Fruit of the Loom\" shirts I previously purchased.I just ordered five more!", "I actually like this brand better than Russell. Better fit for me and material seems a bit thicker. Never heard of MJ Soffe before but the price was comparable so gave them a try. Wasn't disappointed. I like cotton shirts as they get softer and softer over time and breathe really well. Everyone has different body shapes so will have different opinions about clothes. If MJ Soffe is still around when I need more shirts I will buy from them. I noticed that in the clothes world that if you find something that fits well......buy several more now because when you need more they might change the product or might not be in business in the future.", "I have a hard time finding decent fitting long sleeve tee's.  Other products, after you wash them one time they are either too short, or shrink too much and the fit is terrible. Found these on Amazon and took a chance.  They are great quality and fit perfect.  I'm a big guy, 200lbs and 6'1\".  So I buy Extra Large and after one washing they fit perfect! I have them in Black, Brown and White and the Quality is all the same.

However, I like my t-shirts to be loose, not pressing my body, and some Mediums feels a bit constricted. So Large usually fits me best.However, I got this Goodthreads t-shirt in X-Large, and it fit me loose (not too loose), like Large normally does. So I suggest that, whatever size you like best, you get this t-shirt in one size larger.The material is soft and substantial (i.e., not thin or flimsy). The label says \"Soft Cotton,\" and it's true.An attractive dark blue with a front pocket (see photo).", "This shirt is everything I had hoped it would be. It looks great and the 100% brushed cotton fibers feel so good on your skin. I was intrigued by the word suede in the description. It's brushed cotton and it feels so soft. this is a midweight fabric, not heavy, yet not thin. It's very comfortable for my warmer climate.I realize I am supposed to be reviewing this according to the gender it is marketed for so I will do both. First, let me say that the Amazon Brand - Goodthreads Men's Short-Sleeve Sueded Jersey V-Neck Pocket T-Shirt is made with exceptional quality and it did not disappoint. I've had my eye on this shirt long before I was invited to join the Vine program and was thrilled when it became available for review.Usually, 100% cotton fibers aren't the softest, but this one is. It feels almost like suede and is not heavy. II ordered a size small, and it fits my 5'3\", 116 lb, 36DD woman's body perfectly, which may make it a little snug for most men unless you are very slender.I wear a lot of unisex T-Shirts, and this size small fits as expected. I have a variation of this shirt with a V-neck in a size medium and I would say the medium runs a tad smaller than most. This fabric does not have a lot of stretch so you may want to take that into consideration. when choosing a size.As a woman, I find most women's short sleeve T-shirts do not have adequate sleeve length to cover my upper arms to the degree I would like, so I shop the men's department to find the type of coverage I prefer.I love the colors and the retro stripes. This is the type of T-Shirt that works on either gender, although you can tell that is is a men's shirt. However,  I love the sporty look and the 50s era colors on this soft and comfortable T-Shirt.", "This T from Amazon's Goodthreads line has a distinctively retro look.  The sueded cotton, which resembles velour in its look and feel, is the main thing that sets this shirt apart.  The stripy pattern adds to the 70s-era vibe.  The shirt is well-made and super-soft, making it ideal for loungewear or as something to pair with shorts or jeans.  I was surprised by how fitted this shirt is; it's listed as a standard fit but is truly a slim-fit cut.  (As for sizing, I'm an athletic six-one, 175, and the Large hugs every part of my torso.  It's cut long enough for someone up to six-two in height.)", "This is a review of Goodthreads Men's Short-Sleeve Sueded Jersey Crewneck Pocket T-ShirtI have this shirt in XL and XXL sizes. The XL after washing is too tight on my and the short sleeves are short short. The XXL size after washing is fitting more like the XL should have but even so, it's still on the verge of being a little small on me after washing.I like the shirt because it is soft and comfortable but the Goodthreads products seem to run at least a size small. I've never had to wear an XXL in anything before. I'm 6'2\" and about 220 pounds.", "We're fans of Goodthreads products because of the reasonable quality for a reasonable price, and this shirt doesn't disappoint.The fabric of this shirt is very soft a comfortable, an almost velvety nap to it, when normally a tshirt in this price range would be a cheap feeling cotton or cotton blend.  The fit through the body is relatively loose and comfortable - this isn't a muscle shirt at all, and is very forgiving of a middle-aged man's body.  The seams are well finished, and don't rub or irritate, even when you get a bit sweaty doing yard work.  Color didn't run in the wash.The one con that my husband comments on is that there's something slightly \"off\" about the sleeve fit.  They're a bit narrowly cut.  Not quite \"tight\", but don't fit quite like the rest of the shirt.  If your upper arms are heavily muscled or you're a bigger guy, this might not be the shirt for you.", "This is a very nice, 100% cotton shirt with good stitching. My grandson says it\u2019s soft and very comfortable to wear. The colors are a vibrant blue, red and white stripes and looks great with shorts and jeans. The fit is true to size and the length is perfect. It\u2019s a good quality shirt at a reasonable price. I wash this shirt in cold water and tumble dry low to avoid shrinkage and fading of color. With no issues or complaints, I rate this shirt 5 stars.", "This Crewneck is exactly what I look for in a basic tee for my sons. It is made of thick cotton - no polyester blend here - and has a generous cut and fit. The color is muted and there are no annoying logos flaunted on the tee. The pocket lays flat and the stitching is very good without any ruching or loose threads. The back of the neck seam  and shoulder seams are reinforced  with fabric tape.  A good quality cotton tee only softens with time unlike thin cotton blends that often fall apart and develops holes after a few washes.  I fully expect that this one will last a good long time.", "Years ago I was gifted a couple of Old Navy T-shirts.  They were 70cotton/30polyester, super comfortable.  I wear them a lot and would have bought more except Old Navy stopped making them.This shirt is identical except that it's 100% cotton - not a drawback!  It even uses the same stitching pattern.The cloth is heavy enough so the shirt isn't flimsy but light enough so you don't feel enveloped on a hot day.Cloth has a nice feel to it.It's got a pocket which I demand in T-shirts.It's like they tailored the shirt to my specifications!", "Finally! A shirt that runs true to size! Amazon says that the Goodthreads Men's Short-Sleeve Sueded Jersey Crewneck Pocket T-Shirt that I received is an X-Large\u2014and by golly, it is!Recently I\u2019ve received a rash of shirts that claimed to be X-Large (and even XX-Large) but they were anything but.

They came packed in a plastic package that stated trim fit t-shirt. After washing they fit baggy...like a regular t-shirt. So I decided to try buying from Amazon; maybe I'd have better luck. Nope, same problem...these are not trim fit t-shirts. I suspect that C.K. probably has a surplus of regular crew fitting shirts and so are packaging them in the slim fit packages to get rid of them (genuine slim fit's will usually sell out **bc nobody makes them anymore**). I attached some pics so you can see what I mean. Also, the printed lable on the shirt washes completely off after just one wash so that after washing, unless you have the original packaging theres no proof they were even trim fit to begin with.Ive always worn trim fit t's so I know what a trim/slim fit is like. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to find genuine trim fit t's...especially made with 100% cotton. Jockey used to carry a good line of them, but then ditched the 100% cotton and replaced them with this junk spandex garbage and legnthened the sleeves so that its like some sort of short sleeve/long sleeve hybrid. Then, American Apparel carried a nice line of 100% trim fit t's with really thick cotton. They then decided to discontinue the line out of the blue...you cant even find them anymore. So, then Target carries a slim fit brand by Hanes that ***used to be*** \"alright. They were made with 60% cotton/40% Polyester. Now their made with this trash 60% Rayon/40% polyester and are virtually transparent after washing. I have to wear two shirts at once otherwise youd be able to see my nipples and body.These Calvin Klein shirts were a last hope/resort. But no, they sell junk like everyone else. I guess Im just gonna have to start my own clothing line of real genuine 100% cotton trim fit t-shirts. I attached pics of the C.K. shirts I got from Amazon. Total Buyers remorse.", "The cotton material used for these Tshirts is incredibly thin and cheap feeling. When laundered they continue to feel very thin and cheap.  I bought some similar Tshirts from Hanes at the same time which cost a good bit less than half what these Calvin Kleins cost, and the Hanes were of noticeably better quality fabric quality. Both had similar quality of assembly and similar neck banding.  Save your money and shop from different brands. the quality of these was so cheap it has me wondering whether they are in fact genuine Calvin Klein items, or some forged product.", "It was finally time to update the undershirt wardrobe. My old ones were beginning to get a little saggy around the collar. Plus they were Vnecks.

That should be tucked in anyway.I would purchase these over Hanes comfort soft any day.", "As a tall skinny guy, I love these shirts.  They fit perfectly without the flailing in the back like so many tall skinny people have had to deal with over the years.  THEY DO SHRINK QUITE A BIT.

Will be returning asap.", "My 15 yr old son is tall and lean (6'1'' &amp; 28\" waist) and we have had a hard time finding undershirts that are small enough for his frame, but long enough to stay tucked in his pants when he wears them under button-down shirts. I ordered the small and even though the \"bodice\" is not tight and fitted on him, it is good enough because they are long enough to stay tucked in. We will definitely be ordering more of these.", "Overall, these are just ok, not bad, not great, somewhere in the middle. After wearing these for several months along side Polo's and comparing everything to my old Hanes Perfect T's (which are sadly unavailable now and were the BEST T SHIRTS EVER MADE), I've realized that the shoulder seams are NEVER going to sit well and still stick up annoyingly. The Polo's do the same but the Polo's are too long and not for me. Both are the same weight. I just switched to Jockey's tagless cotton shirts and will never buy anything else again.

It's slim (not like spandex, but not baggy at all). And the length is great too, which is very important to me. Slim and long is why I ordered this shirt and it didn't disappoint. If I raise my elbows to shoulder height, my shirt still covers my whole upper body. Only when I raise my elbows head height does my stomach start to show a little.The material is 100% cotton which is both good and bad. I enjoy the feel of the shirt, feels good on the skin and like others have said, it's very thin. Thin woven cotton. The down side is I'm scared to dry the shirt. Most shirts when dried shrink in length and expand wide. That's because of the way they are woven. I 'assume' this is the same. So I won't be drying this shirt anytime soon.Great shirt and will order another in a different color.TLDR: Slim and long for my body type. Thin cotton that feels nice, but drying it will probably ruin the current fit.", "Bought this men's shirt because they sell no women's shirt that cover my butt while I workout.

I felt like a better picture would do this shirt justice for my fellow Amazon peeps, so I decided to post one. As you can see, it's more of a slim fitting shirt as opposed to the skinny look I was looking for. And that's fine for some people. I'm 170, and it stretches on me. But for those who have a huskier build though, like over 200 pounds, this shirt would be great for you. The drop is there, and the material is solid for the price. If it had a slimmer fit, I would still have it no question. But even though I returned it, I will recommend it others for sure. The seller is also responsive and helpful.

We followed the size chart to a T, and the shirt that came is just ENORMOUS. The size of the shirt makes him look like a little kid playing dress up in his father's wardrobe. The seam of the sleeve falls so far down off his shoulder it just looks ridiculous...a good 3 inches down on each shoulder where a properly fitting shirt should fit. The trunk of the shirt is also far too wide. If Amazon wasn't getting a little overzealous with banning folks for their returns (even when legitimate...maybe they oughtta invest in quality control, amirite?), we'd have returned it. But, since I own a sewing machine, I feel like I can at least run a new seam around the arms and make up for the most obvious area of oversizing. The trunk is another story...I don't feel comfortable fixing that myself, so I guess we just have a $17 knockaround shirt.", "Fits great. Exactly what I wanted.", "Best deal, in my opinion. I\u2019m used to wearing inexpensive shirts from H&amp;M that end up being about as contour as a poncho, and ride up in the back. I don\u2019t like either of those qualities.

Large is perfect for me. I hang dry the shirt and it loosens up a bit over the course of 5 washes, which I\u2019m into.

That said the shirt fits pretty well. I'm 5'11\" with a pretty slim build and I ordered a medium. It certainly does not fit like a tight muscle t-shirt. It fits looser than I had expected but I turned out to like that. I really like the neckline on the shirt as it seems a little roomier than alot of other shirts out there. The drop is also nice since most of my white tees were shrinking up but not in. The shirt is a little crooked but not too noticable when wearing and I'm sure is just a one-off."]},

Here's what I found:So that you can judge how the fit I describe will translate to you, I am 6'1\", weigh 190lbs, and I wear a 35\" dress-shirt sleeve. I bought the \"large\" size in all three shirts.I like all three of the shirts for quality and comfort, with small difference in each that may make a difference for you.Fruit of the Loom - I bought black, and it's definitely black. The fabric is the heaviest (thick but also a little stiff) of all three shirts. It fits like an Under Armour shirt, which is to say athletic -- the sleeves are tight and it's fitted in the chest. The sleeves are long enough to reach my wrists without pulling up.Hanes Adult Tagless Long Sleeve Tee (this shirt) - the black is a little on the Navy Blue side. The fabric is lighter, but not thin, and soft. There is a little extra room through the body and sleeves; it feels fitted, but not tight. The sleeves are long enough to reach my wrists without pulling up.Gildan Men's G240 Ultra Cotton Long Sleeve T-Shirt - I bought \"Heather\" and was surprised that it was slightly blue; I was expecting grey. The fabric is similar to the Hanes -- light and soft. There is a little extra fabric around the middle, but it's not a tent. The sleeves are long enough to reach my wrists without pulling up. I hesitated buying this unfamiliar brand until I realized that a shirt I've been wearing for about 6 years was a Gildan.  It's held up very well, so I tried this one.", "Took a risk and bought 5 for my husband, he is a medium but got large in case of shrinking and he loves them! They fit just right and feel great!

Plus, the cotton is so rough I can use it to polish the silver.", "Purchased 8 (2 each in 4 colors) loved the colors, not the material it is stiff and somewhat heavy, (FYI: I believe the reviews vary because all models of the Haines Adult Long Sleeve Tees are lumped into these reviews-but they are not the same, the version I purchased had a very small Neck, others say they are \"comfort tees \" and have a lower cut, larger neck. It would be helpful if reviewers named both the model &amp; the seller in the title on these \" Includes all \" reviews since Amazon does not separate or has a filter that includes model type and seller. I read many reviews that the complaint is on the seller not the product.) Size is terrible. Let me say I believe size depends on the country where it is made. Haines Ts come from 3 countries that I know of. These were from Hati. Spouse wears a med. made in China. I ordered the large, I tried it on and it was to small for me and the neck was to tight, so returned. while waiting for the return I ordered a single shirt in a 2X, before reordering the eight in the larger size. When it arrived I immediately washed it with the thought it would shrink to a 1X, it did shrink somewhat, again tried it on, again the neck was to tight, the body fit but was snug and the arms were to long for me, that's when I gave up, once again knowing there was no way my hubby could wear one of these shirts, so I did not reorder- instead bought similar shirts by Fruit of the Loom at a local store so hubby could return and get a proper fit if needed.

Then I read the tag again to see how it's pre-shrunk. That's disappointing, because it's tight in some areas and loose in others, while the sleeves end up being too long for my arm while being as wide at the end as the shoulders, leading to that tightness around the upper arm. It's tight around the chest, then loose around the waist, and I can't fathom why.It's disappointing, given how I've bought other Hanes Long-Tees, but in this instance, it's actually uncomfortable.

They indeed are a bit larger than what you'd get from other manufacturers in the same size, but that is REFRESHING for some of us bigger folks who buy a T and get something that's too short at the bottom, cut weird in the chest area, and just don't quite fit.  If one orders a \"tall\" version, it's long enough but seems they narrowed the rest of the fit, etc, etc.Key, on the other hand, NAILED it!  First time buying this brand, bought 2, they arrived today and I am so impressed I just ordered 2 more!  The fabric is light but not flimsy.  Extremely comfortable.  I also noticed that the package indicated a \"relaxed fit\", which is how I like my Ts to fit.  Not baggy, but not constraining either, juuuust right.So glad I found these, and Key is reading this, PLEASE keep up the great work and don't change a thing!!  Excellent pricing, excellent quality, excellent fit.  So happy!!!!", "This is a very nicely constructed shirt, which is why I gave it the 5 stars.  I prefer the older Champion shirts, but in the past few years they have changed their sizing and run a little smaller.  These Key Apparel shirts are similar in feel to the Champion shirts, but the sizing isn't the same.  I wear a 3X in the old Champion shirts (the ones available today in 3X are a little too tight and short) and a 3XT in the Fruit of the Loom.  Compared to those two brands, this 3XLT runs bigger.  The length isn't too bad, but the sleeves run past my elbows, making it feel like a hockey jersey. I have a 3XL on the way, so I will update this once I receive that.UPDATE 2/20/18: I received the 3XL and it is definitely a better fit, especially when compared to the FotL 3XT and Champion 3X.  The fit is on par with the old Champion shirts.  Just know that I am not referring to the newer ones as they are a little tighter than the ones they made about 2 or 3 years ago.  I hope this helps those looking to pick any of these up.", "When you're 5'10\" and weigh around 250 pounds it's hard to find clothing that fit right especially after it has been washed. Far too many times I have purchased shirts that fit fine when new, then can no longer be worn after washing due to shrinkage. They usually shrink upwards so buying a larger size doesn't help and I have no interest in walking around showing belly fat to everyone the second I raise my arms up.Well, these shirts are perfect. I like them so much I purchased a few of them. They still fit great after coming out of the dryer.", "I was delighted to find tees in a tall size. Ordered 3. I wore 2 briefly after fluffing them to see how they fit. Liked the feel of the material. Things changed dramatically after the first washing. I was careful and washed 2 of them according to instructions, but they shrunk horribly. Good thing I ordered a size bigger in tall. Compared to the unwashed one, the 2 both shrank in length by 3 inches + and the sleeves nearly 2 inches.  I can wear them, but I\u2019m very disappointed.", "WOW someone actually makes TRUE TO SIZE T-SHIRTS(okay I only ordered 3 GREY ones to try out)...These are the REAL SIZES that we all used to be able to buy....These are very good quality and are actually the RIGHT SIZE....For years in order for many companies to not raise prices to much they had cut down on the fabric used. Which means we were getting smaller sizes, just like they do with food packaging...These shirts at $10 a piece i thought were a little expensive, but when you factor in there a REAL SHIRT, heavy made, good stitching, and actually sized right, and holds up after washing...I have bought other shirts from everywhere and they would fit right out of the package but once washed they would SHRINK 1-2 sizes.....I was wearing a 3XL from the stores and ordered a XL from here and these fit perfect and still fit after washing", "I am 6'2\" and 320.  I bought this shirt in 3XL, tall and regular.  The tall was a little long, it hung over my pockets but not so long as to be annoying.  The regular was just a little shorter but not short enough that my gut hung out.  Even at my weight the shirt fits perfectly.  Not tight at all and not too loose.  Great quality.  I would compare this favorably against the t-shirts from Casual Male/Destination XL at more than twice the price.  Definitely my new choice in t-shirts.  Also, the Key tab on the pocket is very small and only one shirt had a key logo on the back. I found neither to be obnoxious.(P.S.

Hate FOTL (cheap), don't care much for Hanes anymore, had settled on shirts from JCP, but they've stopped carrying them now, sooo....

They are not as heavy and they run huge . Easily one size over normal and are made in Pakistan . Since their 100% cotton I am assuming they will shrink but I have just received them . They are tag less which is nice but they spray in black ink the key name on the back of the shirt like one which I didn't care for but hey Carhartt puts a logo on the pocket of their shirts .I have to give them a 5 though I wish they were heavier the weight is nice . Cotton is comfortable and they are plenty large for layering if you order your normal size . The price is darn near half of other brands at the current sale price . I have learned to not wait and just buy these when I can get a discount at all . These compare to Penny's St Johns Bay shirts , they are higher quality and cut large . They are truly for guys that are big not just tall like the Carhartt's seem to run in each size . I refuse to buy any shirts without a the extra tuck in fabric . These will never show your plumbers crack . Great deal now , the long sleeves even came with hangers I kid you not . For $11 with winter coming these are nice inside the house lounging around in a pair of gym pants . They also are a great layer over a thermal and under a sweater building layers and being large make for allot of trapped air keeping in warmth . Even though it is fall I picked up some short sleeves too for spring to replace the ones I ruined this year . The time to get these is when their discounted . At this price I wouldn't go whole hog but it is rare you find them in the XLT sizes discounted much more as the economy is improving .Colors are flat but nice .", "I'm pretty happy with the purchase. Nice weight, nice quality. Excellent price. Good value.Looking for large size clothes is a pain in the neck.It's a 4xl tshirt.... prices for these get Insane- because they can be hard to find. some price gouging happens. It can be pretty annoying. This was a good shirt at a good price. I was unsure, going with a brand I'd never heard of... you know how it is...decent quality at a reasonable price. I'm pretty happy about it and will be ordering a bunch more."]},

That would run an inferior shoe up to $170.2) Insole cushioning is approximately a 4 on a scale of 1-10.3) Sewn on fabric make up the shoelace eyelets and appear to have no reinforcement for strength - may tear out/off in a short time.4) Single layer of fabric only in the toecap area with zero toe protection or reinforcement; no added fabric inside to keep from wearing through.5) The shoe tongue is single layer fabric, not padded for comfort6) No lace-loop attached to the shoe tongue to avoid slippageAreas that are acceptable, but not over the top on quality:1) The collar lining (foam that cushions the back heel/ankle) is adequate, but best at the back for those who may have a Haglund\u2019s deformity or Achilles tendon problems.2) Soles appear to have good grip3) LightweightI hope this is an aberration from the usual Vionic quality and not what is to be the new normal.

It is just as described.  I got LOTS of compliments.  It was incredible how impressed everyone was despite it being a costume party for royal costumes.  I didn't realize that it came with a crown (really a rubber tiara with 3 orange jewels held by a stretchy strap) so I ended up buying one that I didn't need.  I also didn't realize that it came with the draped faux pearls (which pin to the fur). I ended up pinning those to the BACK of the fur because the back was completely plain--just solid burgundy with no interruption except for the bit of fur collar.  So I bought a child's size royal cape (burgundy velvet with the same snow leopard fur at the top and down the sides) at the party store and sewed it to the waistline on the back of the costume.  It really did the trick!!  It looked like the dress had some layers and a bit of the fur cape showed around the front, too.  It looked really good.  The only other surprise was that the neckline was quite low so I felt like a bit more of the bust shows than I expected.  I had to get it hemmed because I am short (5'2\").  Lastly, the sleeves have quite a large opening on the fur drape portion (there's an inner sleeve in cream that goes to the wrist very nicely) so the pointy/long fur drape part was getting caught on chairs as I walked by (and people's drinks).  Oh, and despite it saying not to wash it, I washed it in cold water and hung to dry and it survived just fine."]},

They aren't even packaged in Hanes packaging, and they say \"Made in Dominican Republic\" ( not where Hanes are actually made). The words \"Hanes\" etc. are NOT embroidered, instead it is a blank, scratchy white t-shirt, with a cheap looking Hanes tag sewn on. These are MUCH more inexpensive than the Hanes that you buy in the store... wonder why? Starting to make sense?I have the original \"Hanes Our Most Comfortable\" T-shirts, and they are way softer. That being said, these look nearly identical, and they fit almost exactly the same, so I understand why people give it high ratings thinking it is the real deal. But trust me, if you buy some from a store and then buy these and compare them, you will find the more expensive store-bought ones (the real ones) are way softer and more comfortable.Oh yea, I forgot to mention...

Out of the package, the fabric was noticeably thinner.  I checked the labels on older and newer shirts, but there was no difference.  Same print, same country of origin.  After the first wear, the troubles began.  It shrunk 2 or 3 inches in length after the first wash.. The fit and feel of the fabric is different, and not in a good way.

Husband would not wear these as anything other than an undershirt. I understand that all bodies are different and these might look banging on some folks. I just wanted to add this point because he has a pretty normal, athletic build that most shirts look nice on and these look slightly awkward.-They're a bit too transparent and thus not ideal for wearing on a typical day.-The neckline is somewhat high, which is great for wearing as an undershirt, but not ideal if you want to wear these solo.

However, they constantly roll upwards from the bottom if not tucked inside my briefs or held in place by my belt. I wear them when I go bed, but they keep rolling up, disturbing my sleep.

I ordered more of these from the same Company and received shirts made in three different countries: Haiti, Bangladesh and Honduras. The material is consistent but the issue is with some variations in fit. Some collars have large head holes than others. The ones from Haiti have had the snugger collar fit that I like so much.", "Love these T-shirts.  I pretty much always buy men's T-shirts because retailers think that women are all short with narrow shoulders, but I am neither.

I have many of these T-shirts in a plethora of colors.  They are comfortable, wash and wear well, and because of the price, it doesn't matter if I paint or garden in them."]},

It runs a little snug (I'm usually between L-XL), but not oppressively so. The neckline doesn't go down too far and retains the nice, crisp point even after multiple washes. The shirt's material is stretchy and breathable. It's great for layering under a denim jacket or blazer.", "This was my favorite shirt, until about the third wash.It is super comfortable, fits great, looks good, feels good even...but after a few washes, the fabric becomes so thin that the shirt is basically see-through.

I've actually had perfect strangers laughing so hard they had tears in their eyes, telling me they hadn't thought of this in decades and that seeing it made their day.

These are Gildan shirts so if you're unsure on size, you can check where you find that brand.

{"asin": "B01MTG4VTD", "comments": ["Reviewing the XL size (which seems to only come in \"XL Tall\").... I'm 6 feet tall, body type is \"waist narrower than chest/shoulders\", and I write from that perspective. (Larger-waisted men will like this shirt better than I do). But first, I'll say that for the low price of ten bucks this is a very good useful shirt with thick cotton and feels good after the first wash. It just does not hang right, but what can you expect for ten bucks? Go to a surf shop and buy an (ugh!!) logo T-Shirt for which you will pay (ugh!) 25-35 dollars.About this shirt's fit:  I love the snug fitting neck. I wish all shirts had a neck this snug, so if that's not your thing, you won't like this shirt.I love the roomy-ness of the shoulders, comfortable... AND if the chest and waist areas were more snug (not tight, just a bit more tailored) then I would want to wear this shirt when I go out. Unfortunately the fabric hangs weirdly off the neck, there are unavoidable folds in the wrong places that hang at diagonals from toward the center of the neck, downward at a 45 degree angle or so.  This is NEVER going to be a \"fashion\" shirt so if you want a shirt that flatters your body... look elsewhere.  But it's COMFORTABLE.The waist and chest are \"roomy\" -- typical American fit, on the \"OK possible to wear it\" side and NOT billowy. The shirt arrived very (too) long way below the belt) but that shrunk up nicely after first wash and hot dry.If you are a guy with a large waist then I think you are going to have trouble with the tightness of the neck. But if you like a nice snug neck fit, trust that this will stretch out over time... as all cotton T-Shirts seem to do after a few washes, especially ones that cost only ten bucks!!But you'll LOVE the looser fit from the chest down, that is, if you are an \"L\" or an \"XL\" guy and not an \"XXL\" guy.The biggest plus of this shirt is the thickness of the cotton. Maybe if ironed, the needless folds running diagonally off the neck will not look so wrong.", "These are indeed heavy T-shirts with great styling. However, I purchased Large size and after one washing (no drying) the shirt had shrunk a considerable amount. The Large size became Medium and would no longer fit. I contacted Amazon to explain the issue. They immediately provided me with a credit under the A-to-Z Guarantee. I repurchased the same shirt in a X-Large size to allow for the shrinkage.", "Last year I purchased the Proclub Heavyweight T in the large size and after a few washes they were a little small in the chest and neck. This time around I ordered XL and its a better fit for me. The neck, chest and sleeves are very comfortable. Thanks to the other reviews that suggested this! Besides the sizing these are my new favorite T-shirts. Heavy enough to last and not so thick that they are uncomfortable.I am on here to order a few more for my wardrobe.", "I got the XL because someone stated that the large was slightly small. The XL fits almost perfect and after a wash it got maybe 1/2 inch shorter and just the right amount smaller in other areas that I would expect a Large to be. If you normally get L I would get the XL unless maybe you like a more snug fit all over. The neck is just right on the white and black shirt very snug. They gray seems a little bit larger but still snug. The sleeves are just right (not loose) and cuff area is snug also. I would say that around the stomach area it is a tiny bit wider than I would normally want (not a deal breaker though). I will buy more and still get the XL for now (White and Black) instead of the L; Except for the gray, which seems to be slightly larger. I will get gray in L next order.", "The quality of the shirt was good for the price. I like the fact that it fits snug around the neck as any crew neck shirt should fit. I don't know why more shirt makers don't understand this. I hate it when I wear a crew neck shirt and it has a big gaping hole that doesn't fit around the neck and makes the shirt look stupid and you look sloppy. Has a very neat appearance.

It\u2019s annoying to straighten them all out when taking out of the dryer.", "There's nothing really special about these shirts. They are t-shirts in plain assorted colors that fit well and are about as comfortable as any other undershirt. The best part about these shirts was the price.

It's a good deal and a wise purchase if you're just looking for a shirt that isn't flashy but won't hurt your wallet either.", "These shirts are a terrific value. Nice colors and free of adornment.The only downside is that the L is a little tight after washing. I have bought XL cotton tees in the past, but they don't shrink enough.  I must be between sizes.

The 3 pack was a great value.", "I go through a lot of black t-shirts working in the technical side of theatrical productions. I needed something that wears well, has a pocket, keeps it shape (a 50/50 cotton/poly blend does that) reasonably well when sweating, but that doesn't cost a bundle so when I rip one or otherwise render it useless, I don't worry about it.

I'm 6' 3\" and have been mistaken at the beach for a Beluga whale by near-sighted Greenpeace activists wanting to drag me back into the ocean.It's rather hard to find these kinds of t-shirts around where I live.  Apparently all good, heavy-weight, all cotton t-shirts are illegal (That's the only reason I can think of for never finding them) because stores just don't sell them unless they have pockets or corporate logos on them.  I'm not happy with the short (as in regular sized) t-shirts I have, and hate being a walking advertisement for some sports company (and they should be VERY glad I don't wear their stuff!) and dislike pockets on my t-shirts, so I took a chance on these shirts and ordered a few from Amazon a few months ago.I love the thicker t-shirts because they tend to wear better than the thin ones.  I'm also a fan of cotton, which breathes much better than even the cotton/poly blends.  When I sweat, rivers downstream from me go over their banks, so breathing is a good thing to let that evaporate instead of inundating unsuspecting river shore residents due to a bad synthetic blend.  The 100% cotton on these makes them excellent in keeping me drier even on hotter days.But the real ornament at the top of this tree is the length.  It sits where a shirt is supposed to sit.  Unlike it's regular sized cousins, it doesn't turn into a halter top at inappropriate or inconvenient times.  Plumber's crack is no longer a problem, either, much to the relief of innocent bystanders who would otherwise be exposed to that horrifying sight.It says it's pre-shrunk cotton and for a change, it is.  I've had these long enough to have them washed several times with only minor fading and no shrinkage at all.  They also seem to keep their fit instead of relaxing and turning into a tent hanging listlessly from your shoulders.I like them so much, I ordered enough to replace all of my shorter t-shirts.  I figure some shorter person will get more enjoyment from those while I thoroughly enjoy my new ones.", "With all the comments on size, and shrinkage I ordered 2 shirts. Both XL Tall. One red, one royal blue. I washed one &amp; set the other aside. The photo attached shows the result. Prior to wash, both shirts measured 23-3/4\" across bottom, 33-1/4 long. After a cold water wash &amp; a normal warm dry cycle the washed shirt measured 22\" across bottom and 32\" long. I'd bet it would shrink further next time.I'm a 6'-1\" 215 pound general contractor. Wear 35-36 pants. I like the quality, not too heavy for summer. But for me, after a single wash was it was way too tight. Especially at neck &amp; arms. If I wanted something tight to body for under a button shirt it would work. But for work or even general wear it's a snug fit. I like my T's a bit loose.I returned both. And will try the 2XL Tall and think it will be the ticket. If so, it's a great shirt for the money. The return process through Amazon Prime could not have been better.", "I'm 6'2\" 400lbs with a big belly, and it's super hard finding shirts that are long enough to make sure nothing is hanging out, especially when you raise your arms, etc.  Somehow I tried a dozen other brands of \"tall\" shirts before trying the Hanes 4XLT, and none of them fit as well as these!  The collar does get a little stretchy so it doesn't look 100% neat, but for a really big guy, having a plain, cheap white T-shirt that fits this comfortably is a rare gift. Would definitely recommend the big and tall sizes.", "Tl;Dr summary:Why is it so hard to find undershirts for a big guy that are long enough to stay tucked in, but don't have commidacly loose sleeves and necks?  A xxxl long should have reasonable arms to fit *under* a shirt, and a neckline that isn't for a late night dancer.--These are great shirts - but, after having ordered three times, I have a lot more than three sizes.  Some shrink a little, some a lot; some come fatastically large, some just right.  This is deffinatley true from pack to pack over the past two years, but it also seems true inside a three pack. Those that come just right are a blessing for a long torso'ed heavy guy like me, but with roughly 1/3 making the cut - it's hard to recommend this product.I'd like to also note that the price for xxxl long Ts shouldn't be multiples of the price for xxl long Ts.  I get they are bigger, but the price gouging is a bit obvious. /endrant", "I've had a lot of Hanes Beefy-T shirts, but haven't bought any in the last decade or so. In the past, the shirt itself was great though the front of the collar came up a little too much on the neck. Other than that, they were borderline perfect. Unless you consider wearing out after about 250 or more washings as not borderline perfect!This shirt, ordered in March of 2018 and worn 5 or 6 times since, including last week, is NOT comfortable and is very tight in the mid-section. This is the tall version and the length is super long -- probably 2 inches more than it needs to be. Some would say, \"no, that's what I want it to be...\" and I'll concede that to be the case as many of us like our shirts to stay tucked. That's why I got the Tall in the first place. So I won't ding the shirt's review over that, but just be aware: you may not need the tall version.However, other than having a tag that remains, the Comfort Colors line of shirts is superior in EVERY way to the Beefy T. It costs a little more, but I'm pretty much done with this shirt.", "Great value for heavy duty 100% cotton t-shirt. I'm only 5'8\" but bought the Large - Tall as I want an extra long t-shirt.

The fabric was thick and durable and the fit was great, long enough without fitting like a tent like you sometimes get with tall sizes. After a couple of years, I ordered a couple new ones. Unfortunately, there was a noticeable dip in quality; the necks on the new batch stretched out in weird ways, and they got holes in the armpits after only a few wearings/washings. I don't know if I got a bad batch the second time, or if the overall quality has dipped over the last couple of years, but it wasn't consistent.Five stars for the first batch I ordered, 1 star for the second.", "I primarily wear these as undershirts, for dress shirts and polos at work.  But they are also nice enough to wear on their own.  They are lightweight and soft.  They shrink a little bit when you wash them (just don't use a ton of heat, and you will probably be fine).  The color stays pretty well, but they do start to fade after months / years of regular wear.  The collar tends to last a little longer than some of the other t-shirts I've owned in the past.", "At 6'4\" it's very hard to find shirts that don't lift up so easily over the waistline.

It is NOT a double layer shirt in any sense. And it looks pretty nice, actually.It's a good shirt.

I am quite sure a couple of hot washings will remedy this,  so I don't consider it a problem.  The white t-shirts arrive with a distinct blue cast to them!

Overall, pretty happy with this shirt, just wish I could use it for my runs and more intense physical exercise."]},

My biggest complaint is the SUPER TINY POCKET!\u00ae (which obviously is trademarked because no sane person would put a pocket this small on any shirt except maybe one worn by a circus monkey. BTW, I'm not a circus monkey).  Let me put it this way: If you put 4 Ritz crackers in the pocket, you'd be about 1-2 crackers over this SUPER TINY POCKET!\u00ae capacity.  It can easily hold a few paperclips or maybe a cotton ball, a handful of M&amp;Ms or about 237 oxygen molecules, but that's about it.  I tried putting my phone in it and the shirt actually laughed at me.  How rude.For the love of humanity and for the sake of proportion PLEASE hire a team of engineers to figure out how to build a normal-sized pocket.  I got these pocket tees because pockets, but these could be more accurately described as \"pockettes\" because they're not full-term pockets.  They're preemie pockets and as such need special care and attention until they grow normal size.

I need to have a three quarter length sleeves. The item was delivered today. It looks nothing like picture.. the sleeves are short sleeves not quarter length. There is also some design on the front of the shirts near the neck.. the shirt that I ordered didn't have anything on the front near the neck. It's also quite small. And I am a small woman so ordering a men's small would normally fit just fine. I'm adding a picture of the item I purchased and then adding a picture of the item I received.", "To start, there are two issues with these shirts - they run large and they ARE NOT 100% cotton. I usually wear either L or XL so I went for an XL expecting a somewhat loose fit - this feels more like a XXL so very over sized (especially the arms) . That being said the only reason I would attempt going for a loose fit because if it didn't fit well I theoretically could return it, or since it's supposed to be 100% cotton it would shrink a bit. Unfortunately this is not the case, the company will not accept returns. So I'm stuck with two massively over sized shits. Will update after a wash cycle to see if they'll shrink a bit.", "Sleeves aren't exactly a 3/4...just a little past the elbows. Very loose sleeves, too, for a baseball style shirt. The material is a little rough and the bottom hem isn't very solid, so I expect it to fall apart as it rolls up a lot. Not a terrible shirt for the price, but I was hoping for something a little longer on an XL since I am 6'1\" and something a little more comfortable overall. I like the look of it, though, but it just doesn't feel like a solid fit.", "It's great.  It feels like thick cotton so it should last a long time", "When I bought this shirt, everything appeared to be fine on it until I washed it. When I washed it, the green ran onto parts of the shirt that was white. The green sleeves tend to run its color onto the white part of the shirt when it's washed. When it does, it's only a small dab and it's hardly noticeable. The shirt fit as expected and it feels comfortable. When I tried to get the small dabs off of the shirt, I was unable to do so even though I tried to hand scrub the spot on the shirt that was affected.", "This shirt is absolute garbage and I would NEVER order one from this company again!  The worst part of it is that the bottom isn't hemmed so it just curls up.  Another bad part is that it just has a very odd fit to it.  I always wear a large but this large is too wide and it's just an overall weird fit.  It might fit some people who are severely overweight or have odd, flabby bodies but it sure doesn't fit me well.  The quality of the material is also very thin and very cheap.  It just doesn't have a comfortable feel to it.  And the sleeves are so wide you can't roll up them up so they just hang there on your upper forearm (even though I'm a 215 lb. man with fairly large arms).  But the worst transgressions is still the curl up at the bottom.  I would never wear this shirt in public but I will wear it at home where nobody can see me.  Maybe I'll use it to soak up fluid stains in my garage or as a cleaning rag?  Oh well, at least I didn't spend much money on it.  I'll stick with name brands next time who actually have some integrity over the product they release to the public."]},

You can wash the dishes now without wetting your shirt sleeves or having to change into a short sleeved shirt.  Why aren't there more  3/4 length sleeved shirts?  There is ample material around the hips without being gigantic at the shoulder and sleeves.  I ordered a size up because I like my knit shirts to not be tight or form fitting.  I haven't washed mine yet, but one reviewer said it shrinks - another reason for going up a size.  When I do, it will be hand washed in cold water.

I am a true size 14 woman, so I ordered a men's Large for myself, which my son also wears; but the shirt is much too small for both of us and will likely shrink even more in the wash.

It says that a large is 41.75 inches, my husband's chest is 38 inches and the shirt is too small. Definitely a disappointment. If it fit as advertised, it would be a 4 star review.

My son was too small for this one (the fit was accurate for the listed size, xs was unavailable) and we tried to shrink it; to no avail! Ha. Keep that in mind, no buying too big \"just in case\" and thinking you'll shrink it if it is, indeed, too large.The colors are as expected. The seams are pretty, um, meh but they always are on AA's raglan shirts.

I'll be buying more in the future.", "I tend to find a lot of clothing I buy that are not well known brands are cheaper but its due to cutting corners. This shirt looks nice and fits for the most part, but it always comes down to the waist and the shirt is a bit short when you get down to the waist.

There are loose threads all over, and each time I put it on, I find more threads hanging off of it to snip. I tried buying a second one, hoping the first one was just a lemon, but nope; exact same.

{"asin": "B07DH4Q6N8", "comments": ["I exclusively use Rearz diapers for when I am at work, or out of my house for hours at a time. I am incontinent so it is extremely nice to have comfortable diapers to last me about 8-10 hours. When I found these Lil' Monsters, I thought it was too good to be true. Such a cute diaper made by the same company that makes the ultra adorable Princess Pink diapers that I use all the time. I jumped at the opportunity to get these.Comfort level is exactly as I would expect from Rearz, absolutely FANTASTIC in terms of comfort. As with other Rearz products, if I do not actively check myself I will leak as I don't feel the slightest bit of discomfort or moisture when wet.The designs are so super cute! I absolutely love them! These are also the only Rearz product (at least that I know of) to have wetness indicators in the form of disappearing Monster \"paw prints\" which is a nice feature to have!If you're okay with a very crinkly diaper, this is your best option! I love the crinkling of my diapers so the extra crinkle of these (compared to any other Rearz diaper) made me super happy!Let's talk about absorbency. So in terms of absorbency, my experience will be a lot different than most people with incontinence issues as I am on a medication that makes me excessively thirsty, thus I pee a LOT. I typically get between 6-10 hours out of the Rearz Rebel or Rearz Princess variety of diapers. The Lil' Monsters on the other hand, I only get between 5 and 6 hours out of (if I'm lucky). I managed to have one last a full 8 hour shift at work, but before I had gotten a chance to change I leaked everywhere. Still, a great diaper in terms of absorbency.The tapes are where the true problem lies. So I am not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but the tapes don't seem to stick very well. Even with minimal movement, like when I'm sleeping, the tapes (especially the bottom ones) tend to come undone. That worries me because if I wear one out to say the mall or to do some shopping it could cause the diaper to leak as a result of the tape not securing it. Something that worries me even more than that is if BOTH bottom tapes go at the same time, and the diaper is already heavy to begin with, I worry that the top tapes would also give and cause my diaper to drop entirely. Thankfully that's never happened. I am a very girly girl in the respect that I love to wear skirts and dresses so that would be a very embarrassing situation to be thrown into. However, if I know I will be out for a while in a skirt or a dress, I will reinforce the tapes with duct tape to avoid such a thing happening (it just makes it an absolute bitch to change but I'd rather not risk leaks or a fallen diaper).Let's talk absorbency once again. This is something hopefully Rearz can explain to me (not really a part of the review). So the Rearz Safari, Rearz Rebel and Rearz Princess Pink are all rated at 4981ml absorbency and 12 hours of protection. The Rearz Lil' Monsters on the other hand are rated at 3700ml absorbency and 12 hours of protection. I'm kind of curious how this works as both are rated for 12 hours of protection but there's a MASSIVE gap (1281ml) between 3700ml and 4981ml.", "Quite absorbent, holds up to the claims made by the company. Not into ABDL, bought more for absorbency than the \u201c characters \u201c on the product.The client is not ABDL, but said other products had more changing than absorbency, an more CNAs stopping by, racking up quite the bill. The client said these hold up better than the others. ( no names are given due to privacy policy )", "So the nice things are they are softer and they wick away faster than any of the other rears diapers. The leg cuffs are all more comfortable and more effective than other diapers at preventing leaks.However, the tapes don't hold very well like the other rears I've tried. I only wear to bed so I wasn't moving much either but they pop off and then don't reattach very well. So keep that in mind. But they were almost my new favorites.", "This is a new review I'm doing. After carefully looking at all my prior reviews I came to the conclusion that they all sounded pretty much the same which was not my intention so I deleted them and starting over/ fresh! Also hope like all the brand new pics! So review time. Rearz is a brand that really does have quality diapers with lil monsters being one of them. Now for comparison these are not as thick as say princess pink and more on the thinner side. That being said still some thickness to them but might be easier to conceal while wearing in public! I also noticed that although comfortable they do seem to bunch/ clump up even while dry after wearing for a long day. I have not had any issues with the tapes at all and honestly guys clear packing tape will reinforce them anyways! I love the colors and design on these! Super cute! All in all really good diaper and only thing I'd change no pun intended is make them thicker! Give these a try because I really think you'll like these and will not regret purchasing them! Hope this wasn't too long or boring but warmed to add some hopefully helpful insight.", "The diaper print is cute. However, I do find the quality is significantly less than the Rearz Safari diaper. So it makes it currently a bit expensive for the actual diaper you are getting.

Is very absorbent!  thank you for company who make his!  from John Bradford", "The tapes stink!  What the heck, Rearz?  This is an inferior product.

Being a Big&amp;Tall guy, I ordered these shirts hoping they would stay well tucked. They did not. They shrunk a bit after their first wash, too.

I bought this for my son, who usually wears a small in men's, and it's a little big on him as a medium, which is actually what I wanted. He's 5'6\" and under 120 lbs. I like keeping one step ahead of his growth spurts so that he never gets short-handed on something to wear when that happens, hence the sizing up. The material feels like an amazingly soft, well-loved t-shirt, instead of the normal performance wear shirts we usually get with the slicker texture. At the same time, it truly wicks sweat and moisture away from the body to make sure you stay cool and dry, and it stretches and moves with the body when you need it to. He absolutely loves how this feels, and it's just a really nice, fantastic quality that looks a cut above the rest...even for just a t-shirt. The blue color - which is accurately portrayed in the picture on this site - really brings out the blue-gray color of his eyes well, and I like that it's a sun-blocker in addition to everything above. I wish all performance shirts were made like this! We are really starting to like the G.H. Bass and Co. brands, as the ones we've gotten so far have been consistently great quality, and the fits are always spot on to what is advertised. While this runs a little big on him (as expected), it isn't stopping him from wearing it right now, because he just loves the texture of it so much. It washes and dries easily, and doesn't seem to wrinkle easily, either. No bleeding, fading, or flaws. It's nice and light to pack while traveling, too.

It's not quite as heavy has a Carhartt, but it's most definitely not one of the trendy thin t-shirts either.  It's a standard thickness that does not cling.- The Irish green is not too yellow or bright.  It's a standard green.Cons:(possibly only for the particular color - Irish Green)- It shrinks up after washing!!!- It shrink upwards.  If you're a man with a belly, you do not want this shirt.  It might even show your belly without raising your arms after a few washes.- The arms shrink very short for a man's shirt.  The arm length is more like cap sleeves, a term men probably don't even know because it is not relevant for men's clothing.- The arms shrink inwards.  The sleeves holes are actually quite tight around.  Not for men who lift weights or have upper arm fat.I took a picture of this T-shirt over top of another Gildan 2XL men's shirt (which fits as you would expect a men's 2XL to fit after a few washings) that I had in the house, so that you could see the arm difference.  You can also see that difference from neckline to sleeve is about an inch shorter too.UPDATE: The description of this product has since been updated by Amazon to read that it's a Ladies, not a Men's T-Shirt.

My only complaint is that they were advertised as 100% cotton.  The red is 100% cotton, but the sport gray is 90% cotton/10% polyester, which meets my minimum cotton requirements, but come on, get it right already.  If people are shopping specifically for cotton, then they are probably picky about it being actually cotton.  Otherwise, well made and a good value.", "These t-shirts are OK.

The XXL was barely an inch longer in the body and sleeves (closer to 3/4 inch actually), with the body width of both being pretty much the same.  I like a slightly loose fit, especially with any shrinkage in mind, so I am going to stick with the XXL on future orders.

{"asin": "B003T8XKPM", "comments": ["One reason people don't review clothes well on here is because they don't state their height and weight and size and the size that they ordered.  That is what helps people buy clothes on line so first let's address that.I bought 5 of these shirts in medium.  I am 5 ft 7 and 155 lbs with a muscular, athletic build.  4 of the 5 shirts fit as I had wanted.  That is to say, they were slim on me and they were also fairly snug on the arms.  This is the look I go for.  If you like bigger, less form-fitting shirts then these would not be the right shirts for you.  One of the shirts (the avocado one) seems like it was sized to big as it was not snug on me in the arms or in the waist.  The mediums that fit me well were the black, the gray, the oatmeal and the light blue.Quality- seems pretty good.  They are soft and comfy and a thinner material.  the depth of the V is good.  It is not too deep and not too high up.  If you are an athletic guy looking for a nice fitting, snugger shirt, this would be a good shirt for you.  Try to adjust the shirt size you order based on the mediums fitting me well at a 5 ft 7 and 155 lb frame.  I will order more of these when the first 5 start to wear out.You can throw one of these one with jeans for a nice, casual go out look.  You can wear to the gym as well as they are comfy.  You could also throw one under a sport coat for a more hip, dressy look.  Hope this helps!", "i'm 6'2\" 170lbs, and this shirt fit exactly the way i wanted it too. It's slim fitting, but not too tight. The material is great. very textured and airy, not like typical 100% cotton that can feel heavier and thicker. I will be ordering more of these.UPDATE: I ordered a second one in a different color. The grey one was smaller (shorter) than the original black one I ordered, both in Medium. One was made in China, one was made in Egypt. I won't order anymore since I won't know exactly which fit I'll receive.", "Hey everyone, Mike Jones here again with another quick and concise Amazon review.So up today we have the Alternative Men's Boss V-Neck T-Shirt, Eco True. For the price point, this shirt really cannot be beat. The fabric is soft and comfortable and even before a first wash it never really had any harsh chemical smell to it. The color choices are really nice and their dark gray and light gray looked really good. I am 5' 9\" and 150 lbs and this medium was a perfect cut for me. The downside is that the quality control of this company seems a little weak. There were some poorly sewn seams and some unevenness to the radius of the sleeves. Amazon, as always, took care of everything, but I can only give it 3 stars due to the fact that it is a solid shirt at a great price but the quality control was low enough that had I tried it on in a store I would not have purchased it.The pros: Great low price, comfortable fabric, fit, and feel. Definitely slim fit but looks good on anyone wanting a tighter shirt. It was true to size and a medium fit me just like a department store medium would.The cons: Some rough edges and uneven lines showed this companies quality control and unfortunately it was a deal breaker for me.The overall: If you want a cheap, soft, comfortable shirt, this is the one to get. I may have just received a bad batch (two different colors had this issue) but I did end up sending them back. I WOULD buy these shirts again, with the caveat being that if the quality control was low on the 2nd order that I would NOT purchase from them again.I hope you enjoyed this quick review. If so, like my review as helpful. Thanks!_Mike Jones\u2122", "They sure look great on the models, but these feel no better than those Old Navy T's that go on sale like ever week, and are cheaper. The cut is slightly better - so if you have wide shoulders, it will fall nicely as opposed to that boxy look. The problem is, the material is super thin. I'm 5' 8\", about 185 and muscular,  with a small tummy. The shirt emphasizes your pecs, arms and shoulders which is great for gym folk, but it also clings to your belly. Not the look I want. Another thing about this type of material - just like Old Navy's cheap T's - they get really out of shape throughout the day... especially if its a warm.  Going back to American Apparel...better cut, better material, and a wide array of color choices. American Apparel shirts  also drape the tummy line rather than hug it, while staying snug around your pecs and arms.", "This is a good shirt.

After reading several reviews about this shirt already being really fitted, however, I decided to go with a large.  It was actually pretty baggy when I first put it on.  After washing it once it fit better, but I'll go with a medium next time to get a really good fitted look. It's a really nice shirt with nice fabric, I just didn't get the right size for my body type.", "Really great, sporting meets relaxed fit. The shirt comes off looking much more upscale than the average solid color t-shirt. However, the material is very thin - almost sheer - you can barely make out my tattoos under the shirt (which I kinda like), so expect this one to suffer more in the wash than other more solid t-shirts.", "To start most people give height / weight and say they are athletic build which doesn't mean anything because \"athletic\" and \"lean\" can be anyone from an anorexic looking marathon runner to a ripped gymnast. I am 5' 9\"; 170lbs, 33\" waist, 45\" chest and 15\" biceps (arm straight). I bought a Large and to me this shirt is almost a perfect fit, my only complaint is that it's a little long (down to my crotch} but then again I'm not your \"average\" build. This shirt is extremely comfortable; the material is very soft to the touch and stretches when you move around without binding or constricting your movement, it ventilates well keeping you cool on hot days. The cut is close enough to show the \"V\" shaped upper torso and slim waist, the shoulder boarders fit perfectly and the arm openings end about 2/3's down my biceps so they're not tight when my arms are straight yet when I bend my arms they stretch and show the definition of my biceps.... basically this shirt shows that you keep your body toned and in shape without looking overly conceded like the bodybuilder wearing the shirt 2 sizes too small! This is the best fitting shirt I've found. Great shirt, I will definitely be ordering more!", "Received shirt without any tags. Shirt is ivory but there are different colored fibers (i.e. gray, black fibers) woven in the shirt. Perhaps this is the \"alternative\" hippie aspect of the shirt? The ivory is the same color as pit stains. Flattering? No, but maybe that shade might look good on someone. Additionally, there was a tiny rust stain on the back shoulder of the shirt. Of course, it could be some alternative organic fiber that just looks like rust. I could have given this product a lower rating, but (1) the shirt is buttery soft (perhaps the lint woven in serves this purpose), (2) I probably should have expected some inconsistency in the material given the \"alternative\" title, and (3) my husband just mockingly berated me for not understanding the startling difference between white and ivory hues that exists. The classic ivory one envisions at a wedding, this is not.  I am not returning this because my husband is going to be wearing this under his dress shirts and won't be on display for public questioning."]},

Then I noticed something.  The cotton tees I was buying started to show small holes after about two to three years of wear.  Meanwhile, three polyester blend tees that I had bought from a bargain bin twenty years ago were still intact.  I had always liked the heather colors of these shirts and had been trying to locate the brand name (Honors) again without success.  The fact that they were proving so resistant to wear led me to think that, if I could not locate that brand, I could at least try some more easily located brand of polyester blend.  These Hanes shirts were reasonably priced, so I ordered four of the blue heather and two of the green heather. From a local Walmart, I also bought a red heather.  When they arrived, I loved them from the first. I buy my tees slightly oversized (I don't like looking at other guys plumber cleavage, so why should I show mine to them.), so there was no problem with fit.  The feel of the cloth was slightly softer than cotton.  I would class this as a lightweight cloth, perfect for summer wear.  For winter, I add more layers if I want to go outdoors, but these are just fine for wearing around the house.  Whether they last as long as my old Honor tees, only time will tell.  Meanwhile I am really happy with them.  In my opinion, These are excellent shirts for everyday casual wear.  The quality is equal to and above shirts selling for three or more times the price.  This goes on my permanent shopping list.", "I really like the shirts - have been wearing them regularly the last several days. I ordered (2) two packs.

Not a huge deal but yes it is. So I went online and purchased some...The ones that I received recently were enormous out of the package. I have a fat neck and they were still loose. I figured after one wash and dry they would shrink to normal. Wrong, the neck was a little smaller but the length lost at least 4 to 5 inches. The length before the wash/dry was super long but I cant complain about that because I usually tuck in my shirts when wearing an undershirt. Now they are not the tight necks I am accustomed to and they are a pain to keep tucked in.Overall, they are still comfortable but way overpriced.

Not quite as slim as I would have expected right out of the bag, too much fabric in the waist for a slim fit, but ok nonetheless. Since I liked the shirt and it was inexpensive I bought a couple more of different colors and all size large. All ended up being inconsistent in sizing, and all were larger than the navy/white.The black/grey and red/navy were slightly larger than the navy/white. I decided to keep them because they were tolerable. But the heathered grey/white should have been considered an extra large. Waaaay larger than what should be considered normal variance. When placed on top of the navy/white the entire shirt was easily 1-2\u201d larger than the navy/white. Neck was wider, sleeves longer, body of the shirt was huge.Then I washed the shirts. They all shrank almost a full size, even when washed on cold and low dryer according to the tag.  The navy/white and red/navy shrank the least and are still wearable after some manual stretching, but the black/grey easily shrunk to a size medium and no longer fits even after trying to stretch it out.So the shirts are ok, in that the material is not bad and they\u2019re only $6 a shirt. But be prepared that sizing varies across each color and plan for some pretty significant shrinking.", "Coffee stain? Blood stain? Either way, returned!", "The first thing I noticed about this matching pair of Ts is the weight of the material.  Much more substantial than what I'd expect in an inexpensive T.  The light-gray stripe pattern also sets this T apart, making it something you could wear as a stand-alone shirt with jeans, khakis or shorts, as well as a base layer.  My only knocks on the shirt are that the crew neck is cut higher than I'd prefer and that it's more of a traditional fit than a slim fit, especially around the lower torso, where it billows out more than I'd like.  Size-wise, I normally wear a Large, and the X-Large fits me about right after putting the shirt through a wash and dry cycle.  Note that you should avoid using a drier if you don't want the shirt to shrink from its original size.  (For reference, I'm six-one, 175.)", "The price on these is pretty unbeatable. $12 for two really decent tee shirts? There are some really awful tee shirts in this world, but these are not that.These are 100% cotton, generously sized so that they will still fit after washing.

The cotton material is a medium weight \u2013 there are thicker tee shirts, but you're not going to feel like these are too thin.They are made in Pakistan.I have to say, for the price in the listing, I was not expecting something like this.

He wore a shirt like this - white with light brown horizontal stripes.  Well, aside from that bit of trivia, this does look all right on me.  I don't like horizontal stripes because they just make me look fat.  Which may or may not be true, but I sure don't want a shirt to accent it!  Fit is tight but stretchy.  It fits snugly and I do like that just fine.  Makes a nice shirt to wear under a long sleeved button up - flannel, perhaps.  Comfy and soft!", "These crewneck striped shirts are a bit of a nothing.  They are a five star nothing, but a nothing none the less.Since they aren't plain white, they can't really be used as an undershirt.  But they have a lot of the same characteristics.  They are very basic.  They fit well. They are soft to the touch.Overall, I have nothing to complain about with these shirts, but I also have no accolades of praise.I wear them to sleep.", "Made in Pakistan from a 60/40 cotton/poly blend, this is an unusual horizontal stripe t-shirt which looks great and can be used either as undershirt or on its own on a warm day. No scratchiness from the polyester, which does a good job keeping the shirt wrinkle-free out of the wash. Haven't noticed any shrinking, but I use cold water and gentle dry cycles. There's a nice weight to the material, just a little more than for a standard Jockey t-shirt.", "I love the material of these shirts.  It has a nice weight and is super soft.  The stripe pattern works well with the style, but the way it is hemmed and stitched is a little off.  Basically, the shirt looks like a pajama top or undershirt.  That isn't such a bad thing, given how much I like wearing it, but a few style cues from other major brands would make this much better.", "Excellent and comfortable shirt, slim is perfect for 5'5 and 125-135 lbs,. Length wise, can be pulled to stretch to the things or further, but thats if you really stretch it which is usually not a normal situation.Doesnt shrink in the washing machine (cold and dryer) and doesnt seem to fade or look like the thread is peeling after several wears.", "I really like these t shirts, and wear them daily. A couple of them came in for me. They are fully cotton and that is a high preference for me. The cotton is soft and slightly stretchy - it feels great on my skin. Must laundry them once to achieve that slim fit look and feel. Good for playing sports, and casual wear."]},

There were lots of pockets for organizing stuff, the zipper pouch that stores the backpack turns into an inside zipper pouch (reversible zipper) that conveniently holds small wallet, lip balm, etc and the outside zipper pocket was deep enough to hold water bottles.

As for temperature regulation, I will say that it's not quite as cooling as I would like, but it does prevent extremes, and totally eliminates that \"sticky\" feeling when you sweat or it's humid out. It's a bit more fitted than I normally like, so you might want to consider sizing up if you're close. A product really needs to be amazing to get a 5-star review from me, and this one qualifies, but I had to knock a star off for the black color, as the fabric attracts lint and pet hair like a magnet, and it's very visible on the black.

I need to look fashionable while in Italy, functional while in Germany and meaningful while Austria.\"  Being that I live in a mountainous state, I understand the importance of packing light which can also mean less stuff, so 20 days and 4 tshirts while achieving my minds input... V-neck Merino Wool pulls it off!!!I place the order but wasn't sure about the size, email the company and within minutes I get a reply from an actual manager!  Wow, he follows up completely making sure of my needs and that the size was right.  He assured me of the exchange policy and was amazingly forthright.I get the order and being new to Merino wool (because in the past I was suckered into the whole Nike/Under Armour/Big Name marketing B.S.) I thought I would REALLY put it to the test!  So I pull the shirt out of the bag put it on and went for a hike...  4 hours and very sweaty later, no smelly shirt.  Thinking, well it's new, and that's not putting it to the test, not my level of test at least.  Take the shirt off put it at the end of the bed and no I wasn't waiting to see if the dog or girl friend would smell it!  I got up in the morning and put it right back on and off for a 16 mile hike into the mountains.  Get back and straight to the restaurant, yet no body standing next to me, my friends of course, mention that I should change... I inquire, \"Doesn't anyone here smell BO?\" the stop smell and answer, No, Nope, Nothing and of course the \"Why, did you fart?\"  I thought Woolly Merino Wool shirt this just might be the real deal.  However, I'm still not convinced, as those new chemicals these days just might make it last and I don't like that, so onward.  Again, putting the shirt at the end of the bed and another night goes by but this time no shower, morning comes and yep put the exact same shirt back on.  Out again doing errands around town, cleaning the 4-Runner in the sun which takes me about 3 hours and cleaning up around the yard but nothing hard or too dirty but hot.  Evening comes and guess what, no stinky shirt!  Thinking, ok let put it to the real test, no shower again, back to bed and up again, at this point I STINK!  So really Merino Wool... as I eye the shirt, do you really think you can over come my stinky body now, on goes the shirt and off to a hike I go with the girl friend. 7 miles hiking up and around the mountain, playing with the dog and having not showered in three days and two nights, I am disgustingly dirty and reek, I get home and can't take it... I shower!  I ask the girl friend to take a whiff of the shirt and she comments, \"Was that the shirt your wore today?  Because it barely has any smell to it.\"  WOW!!!So there you have it, Woolly Merino Wool shirts are the real deal!  Fashionable, functional, meaningful and providing me with the protection those \"other brands\" claim to have but only offer you marketing!BUT... what about the comfort!?  I was very impressed with the comfort of the shirt.  The V isn't low like a undershirt and isn't tight like a regular shirt.  It fit just right and offered me the movement I needed.  It rare that you find a product that you look at and think, I can thought that on go for a hike, a out with the girl friend and stop by the martini bar all in the same day, in the same shirt and everyone has nothing but positive comments to make!How about the shirt after I washed it, you wonder!?  Well, I have to admit that I washed it in delicate and with woolite for the simply reason of the fact that when I find something I like, I take great care of it (Like my 4-Runner!).  Post washing, I travelled up north and hiked a 14'er and camped for three days and never changed shirts and it was fine.  I wash myself at the stream and with some bio wash, but didn't do anything to the shirt.Any followups?  Yeah, so I went forward with ordering two pairs of socks and five pairs of boxers from Woolly for my trip.  I will post a review for each under their respective product.Am I pleased? VERY and glad that I purchased the product.  It's funny, because I leave in a week (Sept 2nd) for my 36~ days Europe trip, 20 hiking and 10 in Italy as a tourist and 4 Munich for Oktoberfest and a couple in Iceland for the Northern Lights... I gazed into my drawer being HIGHLY selective about my clothing and realizing how much have I spent on those other companies marketing hype!  Save your money young ones; buy Merino Wool, support a entrepreneurial company buy Woolly and save your money to go on a trip like I am!!! Don't buy into the whole marketing scam those other companies offering, Polyester is polyester, PERIOD so changing the pattern or lies about adding chemicals are going to change the fact that it's polyester and it sucks (BUT IT REALLY REALLY CHEAP TO MAKE!!!)Closing thoughts, Merino Wool is natural, renewable and if treated right long lasting.  I'm very happy that I purchased these shirts and from this company.Please feel free to ask me any questions!  Yes, I will post some videos when I get a chance but I don't return from my trip until the second week of October (open ended on the return!).", "All I can say is wow. As my first Merino wool article of clothing this definitely lives up to the hype. I happened to receive my shirt the same day I had to unload our moving truck and spent the entire day sweating in 90+ degree heat and humidity. 24 hours (and one shower) later I'm still wearing the shirt and it looks and smells like it just came out of the package. I'm determined to see how long I can wear it before it needs a washing ha! So far I have spent 12 hours moving while wearing it and then put it back on after a shower and slept in it. I will definitely be replacing my cotton tees with these over time.", "The fit was a little snug, especially around the middle, but that may be more the result of my personal shortcomings then the cut of the shirt.The major issue I had with this shirt was that after all I had read about merino wool I still found this shirt to be super itchy! I may try again with a different brand because my understanding is that merino wool is supposed to be particularly soft. I, personally, didn't feel it.Edit: After a series of back and forth emails with Mike over at Woolley I'd like to amend my prior review and now say that this is with out a doubt my favorite T.What I've come to understand is that the sizing  on this particular product is intended to be form fitting and not to mimic the cut of a hanes cotton crew. With that in mind the material being pressed on your torso from all sides will likely trigger issues for sensitive individuals such as myself.Mikes remedy was to give a shot at one size up. This coupled with a quick wash with a few pairs of denim and I'm now finding the material feeling more along the lines of what I was hoping for. After a few weeks dedicating this as my exclusive undershirt I've begun to find my usual cotton shirts to be uncomfortable.Darn you guys at Woolle! You're going to turn me into a merino snob!", "Wonderful fit and feel with this t-shirt. Arms are snug but not binding in anyway. The body is a bit looser but not baggy, saggy or anything like that. Nice and smooth feel. Not bumps or pills. Feels silky, much  like mercerized cotten feels. Washed and dried it only once, with absolutely no isses at all. It was washed with a errant kleenex in the washer and the lint on this shirt when i removed it from the drier just shook right off. Easy peasy! And after having it on for 3 days and nights there was absolutely no oder, smell or greasy feel to it like a cotton t-shirt often gets!I live in vegas and it is perfect for our  90+ degree heat. For winter i will use a heavier one as im always cold. But this thin one is absolutely perfect in  the heat. Even when in the sun. Never got sweaty.  It seems about perfect to me. But if it doesnt hold up or develops any holes ---- i'll let you know!!", "I am a 5\u20195\u201d,140 lbs, small-framed guy and got a size small. I\u2019d say the fit is a relaxed fit, but true to size. The color \u2018linen\u2019 is sheer as some people have mentioned. But if you can look past that, everything else about it is as advertised. Wicks away odor and sweat, dries fast, feels cool in warm weather and warm in cool weather. It does feel itchy at times and emits that wool smell as does everything made from wool. Over all, a great shirt for those wanting to try out merino wool shirts.PS: I also bought the round-neck version and am equally happy. Based on those two products, I\u2019d say quality control is good.PPS: I\u2019d follow the care instructions for this shirt since it is made of merino wool and not your run-of-the-mill cotton to maintain the quality. I feel merino wool can be delicate if not properly cared for."]},

I don't get the negative reviews on this bag, it does everything the seller says it does and is super durable.

This bag is military tested and military approved.", "I had the non-Lx version of this backpack for several years but accidentally broke the laptop side-zipper (my fault, not a fault of the bag's workmanship).  Unfortunately Oakley doesn't do repairs so i researched replacement bags.  Every bag I looked at just couldn't compare to the Kitchen Sink.  I finally decided to just buy the same bag again although I liked the color of the Lx version.

It does feel a bit coarse and scratchy on first wearing. Doesn't bother me. I'm a cyclist who wears merino wool cycle jerseys, and this feels similar. Stitching is good quality, and buttons and leather-look feature have survived a few washes and look new. Looks casual and classy at the same time.", "I got this for my husbands birthday, since he's had his eye on this top for a couple of months.PROS:- Really nice quality shirt.  It's a great, thicker material that looks high end (it doesn't look cheap, or made with thin material that falls apart after a few washes)- The design is true to the picture. It's perfect for those who want a unique twist on the average shirt. It looks great on professionals (toss a pair of black dress pants on), and for casual wear with jeans or shorts.- Feels very comfortable and breathable. Even in the underarm area where some shirts may fit a bit tight, this one feels really good and you have full freedom of movement.CONS:- It does appear to run slightly small. My husband is 5'10 and 155 lbs (he has a slender build). He usually wears a size medium, but after reading other reviews I went with a large and it fit great. The attached image is him wearing it after it's been run through (multiple times) on the normal cycle in the wash / dryer.- It is made from a thicker material, so, while it is breathable - it may get a bit warm wearing it if you're going to be out and about in the hot sun.

HONESTLY; it did fit as expected--- But after washing it in COLD WATER and HUNG TO DRY- IT SEEM TO LIKE THE CLOTHES HANGER BETTER THAN ME!", "The shirt itself seemed fairly true to size. I'm 6'3, 210lbs, and a muscular build. I usually wear a large. For this, I ordered the Asia XXL (US XL). It is indeed a bit big on me, and I'd expect that after a run through the washer/dryer, it would fit perfectly. The neck was about the right size, and the sleeve and torso lengths were good.That said, I don't plan on ever wearing it. The material on this shirt feels terrible to me. It's very heavy and just a little stiff -- kind of like wearing a burlap sack. It's also a very low thread count, which means the material feels rough and a tad scratchy. Still, other reviewers have posted that they like their shirts, so I think this is a matter of personal preference. Before ordering one, just make sure that this is really what you want.", "I ordered several athletic-fit shirts from H2H. According to their size chart I ordered large for all of them. Every shirt fit properly except for this one. It runs a bit small and \"very\" tight in the shoulders and torso. I was able to put it on easy enough, but it was not comfortable and looking in the mirror it looked small. I am normally a large for most shirts (@ 6' 187 lbs &amp; about 42 shoulders), sometimes a medium for certain t-shirts (if I'm going for the slim fit look). I recommend you order +1 size larger than your normal size for athletic fit shirts. I reordered a US XL and it fits well. Overall the shirt is very nice just sized a bit strange", "Some reviewers mentioned this is a little scratchy.  I don't disagree with that, but it's also not like wearing burlap or coarse wool either. I ordered a size up knowing it ran small and in line with my other H2H brand purchases. I think I was between sizes for this cut somehow because I was expecting it to be tighter, but I don't think I could have squeezed into the next smaller size. This is a nice, basic wardrobe piece that dresses up the jeans/shorts and t-shirt look for not a lot of money. Not sure I would buy this exact style again, but the H2H brand has been good to me so far.", "Bought the short sleeve version.  It appears to be good quality on initial assessment.  I am 6 foot and 210 lbs but not real big in the chest or shoulders.  The XL size fits well.  It would be tight if I added another 5 or 10 lbs.  As long as it does not shrink, I am good with it.  The material is pretty soft out of the bag.  I expect it will get softer with a few washings.  So far, so good.", "I'm 5'9\" 175 lbs with an athletic build and 33\" waist.  I ordered an XL and it's a bit snug.  The shoulders are cool because they are slightly squared giving the shirt a tailored look.  The neck opening is larger than a normal pull-over shirt.  I have a larger muscular chest and it fits nice here, but the torso is tighter than I imagined it would be.  If you want to show off your six-pack it's good, but consider a larger size if you have the least bit of a tummy.  This is not a summer shirt - it's like a thermal, and even with the short sleeves it's better suited for Fall.", "Nice stylish casual shirt.You can even get away with the nex size. It will hang a little longer. I done this because my son is tall. So he can wear the shirt longer. I would buy the shirt again. Very honest seller, everything explained right to the point. Great price and shipping!!!! The dark brown buttons and leather tab below last buttons dresses the shirt up. Leather cowboy boots goes nicely with shirt and a brown jacket goes well. Even a black or brown leather jacket looks great!!!! The shirt goes great with a button up shirt or flannel shirt!!!!!", "I bought this shirt for $15, not expecting much, hoping to wade the waters of this company. I just received it in the mail today and am currently wearing it. First, I will talk of the material:The shirt itself is made up of standard thermal cloth like you find on a thermal shirt from a Department store. The leather patch on the V is made of a light brown synthetic leather. The buttons are brown plastic. The stitching of the shirt seem to be solid. Usually on cheap clothes I order I find problems from the beginning, but everything seems well.The fit of the shirt is slim, but otherwise good. I wear a US L and I ordered the Asian XL as the guide recommended. It fits well. Please note that I  am 6'1\" and 176lb. It is definitely slimmer along the torso than most shirts, but not to a sever or bad degree.The shirt itself looks very nice. I paired it with khaki chinos and some oxfords and it looks spiffy.Overall, I would say that I could compare this in quality to some more expensive shirts from other brands that cost 30-40$ and be justified. If you're considering this shirt, I recommend you try it. It is definitely worth $15.  After this review I am going to buy 3 more in other colors :)"]},

Because they're white and I might wear one more than a day or two (just to sleep in) I like to bleach them and they stand up well to that.

I wanted the men's sized, regular black cotton tee I was so in love with, where I could predict the normal stretch with wear (of a standard cotton tee), the fit, and the results of alternations if necessary (I tend to cut out the neckline on my t-shirts, and absolutely would not have done so with that Hot Topic piece of, whatever you want to call it) and I found it here. This shirt was 100% what I wanted, what I remember from my original tee and I could not be more thrilled. THANK YOU!!!", "I am very disappointed with the quality of this shirt. I purchased two. 1 was machine washed with other clothes. 1 was hand washed. The machine washed shirt leaked purple dye into the rest of the clothes. The hand washed shirt also leaked a lot of purple dye. Even when handwashed for a second time, the shirts are still leaking a lot of purple dye ( looks red in images). I would advise anyone buying these shirts to handwash only with no other clothes which is very inconvenient and impractical.", "I've ordered shirts like this before and they're just cheap thin worthless shirts, you know the kind your affraid to put in the dryer because it may desinagrate or snagged by the Dryer Phantom....BUT......This shirt is one of the best quality \"T\"  I have seen in a long time ! Not only will I be scared of the dryer phantoma anymore, but actually might be able to pass it down to my son...QUALITY PRODUCT...", "I owned this t shirt years ago and I couldn't find it so wanted to buy another.  Read the reviews about different suppliers of this shirt on Amazon and they were mostly horrible so wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this one.  Anyway, it is the real deal.  Fits like it should.

Unfortunately, the neck is WAY too big. Who wants a neck line half way down their chest?", "When did 100% cotton start feeling like polyester?

It's a bit too small and short. Now I have a longer torso than average, but this would be too short on a normal person. But that aside the shirt is nice. It's printed nicely, no mistakes that I can see, on a heavy cotton tee, probably pre-shrunk. After several washes the logo is still just the same as brand new, no fading or peeling. So it's a really good shirt. Just wish I had ordered a size up.", "My 13yr old son likes to pretend he's cool, so I bought him this to wear with his black Chucks. He calls it edgy.

I mean this thing is huge! It looks at me with rage in its eyes and while roaring it stood on its back legs. That\u2019s when I saw it... this thing is packing a set of cock n balls the size of a wiffle ball bat with a potato sack hanging from it! It starts to charge so I take off running knowing that if I were to fall I would most likely be raped to death by this clearly sexually deranged bear.  I fled toward a large cliff fearing I was trapped when I happened to glance at my shirt and see the glorious bald eagle soaring along the side of our supreme leader riding a tank in front of an American flag when it hit me.  Your going to have to jump.  I quickly ripped my ultra patriotic shirt off as I kept from the edge.  Holding the four corners the shirt inflated almost as large as my love for America as it slowly glided me to safety hundreds of feet below.  From the safety of the ground I could see the bear and his giant genitalia staring down at me enraged by my escape.

Day one of wearing it i literally pissed red white and blue for 2 days straight. Day 2 of wearing this I became self aware of all things in existence, now I can even do my taxes by myself.

The discoloration effect and print were done in USA. The detail of the print is amazing!", "Terrible item. Not silkscreen. Looks like one of those cheap iron on transfers from the 70\u2019s. What\u2019s worse is the transfer is not even clear. Very blurry. I asked for a refund several times from the company, who is based overseas. After emails back and forth with them, each time them asking me to accept a partial refund because shipping back to them would be very expensive, I accepted their partial refund, mostly out of frustration. I ended up cutting it into pieces and using it for grease rags. It did work fine for that purpose."]},

The gray and blue shirts fit well and are quite comfortable. However, gray shirt feels a bit better than blue one. The brown shirt is horrible in every aspect. It is short and wide.

{"asin": "B07NFSWWNR", "comments": ["I really like Hilfiger clothes.  I've had dress shirts and more casual items (including this T) over the years, and they are durable, well designed and attractive.  But they always run a little small.  Not quite \"slim fit\", but for a guy who runs about 30 pounds overweight, but usually fits into a \"large\" with no issues...Hilfiger is always just a bit snug.  (Makes for a great \"aspirational\" garment if you're trying to lose weight.This t-shirt leans towards NOT being an undergarment.  It has a pocket (which I like because I wear glasses for distance viewing and need a place to keep them).  It is well stiched and the fabric is attractive.  Not just a pure solid color but a little bit of shading.  Of course, at the price, you want something more than a generic $8 t-shirt from Target.  I can certainly recommend it, but remember, if you're a little overweight, it might be snugger than you like.", "There's nothing too special about this tshirt. It fits well enough and feels nice enough but it will shrink in the wash like any other tshirt and there's nothing about this that makes it any better than an average tshirt. If you like the Tommy Hilfiger logo or are a fan of the brand then this is for you, otherwise you might want to just get an Amazon Basics gray tshirt. I know I personally am not a fan of the little Tommy flag logo on the breast pocket but it's small enough not to bother me too much so I wear it despite that. There's a lining along the back of the neck that seems like it's there to keep the neck from stretching out over time but it really doesn't seem to do anything except make the back side of the neck hole larger.Overall a very average tshirt.", "This is a fine t-shirt---but fine doesn't really cut a $30 price tag for a t-shirt. It's soft enough and pretty thin. It's almost thin enough that it's trending towards an undershirt, and visibility through the shirt is definitely an issue. The fabric is drapey, which is lethal when combined with the thinness of the shirt seeing through it inappropriately.The fit is good around the sleeves and waist, but I do think that the shirt rus a little long - and I'm 6'3'' and got a medium, so it should absolutely not run long. The crew neck cut and pocket look good, and exactly like the picture. The shirt seems to handle laundering OK and has no holes, but the material is thin enough that I am worried about the longevity. The shirt also became significantly less soft after just one wash.Realistically, there's nothing that sets this shirt apart from a $10 t-shirt besides the logo - it looks and feels exactly the same. Even considering brand, similarly expensive competitors sell single t-shirts closer to the $10-$20 range. If you're a die hard Tommy Hilfiger fan, this shirt won't disappoint - it's exactly what you see in the picture - but others may want to find a more reasonably priced option.", "For me, Tommy Hilfiger shirts are hit or miss.  The quality has always been very high, but it's the fit that I'll either love or hate.  Usually, it's just that the sleeves are way too short and tight for my tastes.  These sleeves are a bit shorter than I'd normally wear, but they are just the right size around and glide on my arms, so they don't _feel_ too short to me.  Also, the chest and waist fit great, and the length is very good for me.The fabric is wonderfully soft and comfortable.  I really just love to have one of these on, and I ordered three of them in various colors, all of which I like.  The shirts are lightweight and fairly thin, but the fabric is dense and not cheap feeling at all.  It's a high quality cotton fabric.I usually buy t-shirts in the $10-$15 range and wouldn't usually consider a t-shirt in the ~$30 range (polo shirts for sure, but not t-shirts), but these are truly better than the ones that I usually buy.  If you don't mind the price, I highly recommend them.", "This is definitely a well made shirt with 100% cotton fabric and a discreet logo that doesn't scream for attention. However,  I expected a slightly darker blue on this shirt but it is almost a heathered baby blue look. A few shades darker and it would have been perfect. It is a mid weight cotton with the bottom edge being turned in a serged with red thread and not hemmed. I find that a serged raw edge usually unravels after a few washes but, hopefully, Hilfiger items are sturdier than most. As it is though, it is a nice high quality tee that will go well with chino shorts or dockers for a casual afternoon.", "The Good:-Great fit (I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and slender frame)-Stylish-Launders well-Comfortable and softThe Bad:-NoneThe Bottom Line:I\u2019ve worn this shirt a few times already and it pairs really well with jeans so I can just throw it on whenever. The shirt launders well and overall very comfortable. I would recommended this shirt.*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.", "The cotton material is very thick and high quality. The logo is rather small, so if your brand conscious in a way that you want others to see the brand (like my son), you might want to look further.  The pocket is reinforced well, and the color is a dark navy blue that didn't fade when I washed it.  My son is slim, about 5'4 and 117 lbs. and this was a little wider than he likes. It shrank some, but he still fills it is too big. He still fits into a boy's size 18, so I think the small is true to size, maybe even a tad larger.", "I love me some Tommy Hilfiger clothes including just \"plain-ol\" tees or pocketed tees like this one. There's not too much to say here. You're getting a 100% cotton shirt that's made to modern standards - no \"beefy tees\" here. This shirt is made from super soft cotton that fits like a quasi-tailored shirt. In other words, the fit is a little more flattering than a boxy t-shirt of old.The crew-style neckline is done really well and so far after a few wears and cycles through the wash, it's holding up like new.  The addition of a pocket is fine. I'm not typically keen on pocketed t-shirts (has anyone used a pocket on a t-shirt?) but TH did just fine with the pocket on this shirt.In closing, a well-made and up to modern standards t-shirt that's comfortable and looks good. Recommended!", "I own several Tommy Hilfiger items and have always been happy with their quality.  This short sleeve crew-neck shirt is yet another great item.  It is 100% cotton and is thicker than most shirts.  It can be used as a regular shirt instead of just an undershirt.The blue heather color looks great and is different than the regular grey colors that I usually wear.  There is one pocket on the front of shirt, more for styling than actual use.  The Tommy Hilfiger logo is very small and is on the front pocket.The fit of the shirt is great.  It fits great at the waist, chest and the shirt length is below belt line.Overall, a great looking and fitting shirt from Tommy Hilfiger.", "Very nice looking, bright white t-shirt that looks great with jeans or as an undershirt. The fabric looks thick but it is actually lightweight and you can see through it so I would call it a \"thin\" material. There are some nifty details. The collar is ribbed and features a black and red striping along the back of the neck. There is an odd triangle patch in the center of the back of the neckline that has interfacing. The front pocket is narrow and small and also has interfacing. There is the small Tommy Hilfiger logo on the pocket, fortunately it is not intrusive. There is very nice stitching work along the pockets, around the sleeve cuffs and along the neckline. The shirt is attractive and appears to be very well made."]},

I'm 6' 3\" and have been mistaken at the beach for a Beluga whale by near-sighted Greenpeace activists wanting to drag me back into the ocean.It's rather hard to find these kinds of t-shirts around where I live.  Apparently all good, heavy-weight, all cotton t-shirts are illegal (That's the only reason I can think of for never finding them) because stores just don't sell them unless they have pockets or corporate logos on them.  I'm not happy with the short (as in regular sized) t-shirts I have, and hate being a walking advertisement for some sports company (and they should be VERY glad I don't wear their stuff!) and dislike pockets on my t-shirts, so I took a chance on these shirts and ordered a few from Amazon a few months ago.I love the thicker t-shirts because they tend to wear better than the thin ones.  I'm also a fan of cotton, which breathes much better than even the cotton/poly blends.  When I sweat, rivers downstream from me go over their banks, so breathing is a good thing to let that evaporate instead of inundating unsuspecting river shore residents due to a bad synthetic blend.  The 100% cotton on these makes them excellent in keeping me drier even on hotter days.But the real ornament at the top of this tree is the length.  It sits where a shirt is supposed to sit.  Unlike it's regular sized cousins, it doesn't turn into a halter top at inappropriate or inconvenient times.  Plumber's crack is no longer a problem, either, much to the relief of innocent bystanders who would otherwise be exposed to that horrifying sight.It says it's pre-shrunk cotton and for a change, it is.  I've had these long enough to have them washed several times with only minor fading and no shrinkage at all.  They also seem to keep their fit instead of relaxing and turning into a tent hanging listlessly from your shoulders.I like them so much, I ordered enough to replace all of my shorter t-shirts.  I figure some shorter person will get more enjoyment from those while I thoroughly enjoy my new ones.", "With all the comments on size, and shrinkage I ordered 2 shirts. Both XL Tall. One red, one royal blue. I washed one &amp; set the other aside. The photo attached shows the result. Prior to wash, both shirts measured 23-3/4\" across bottom, 33-1/4 long. After a cold water wash &amp; a normal warm dry cycle the washed shirt measured 22\" across bottom and 32\" long. I'd bet it would shrink further next time.I'm a 6'-1\" 215 pound general contractor. Wear 35-36 pants. I like the quality, not too heavy for summer. But for me, after a single wash was it was way too tight. Especially at neck &amp; arms. If I wanted something tight to body for under a button shirt it would work. But for work or even general wear it's a snug fit. I like my T's a bit loose.I returned both.

The return process through Amazon Prime could not have been better.", "I'm 6'2\" 400lbs with a big belly, and it's super hard finding shirts that are long enough to make sure nothing is hanging out, especially when you raise your arms, etc.  Somehow I tried a dozen other brands of \"tall\" shirts before trying the Hanes 4XLT, and none of them fit as well as these!  The collar does get a little stretchy so it doesn't look 100% neat, but for a really big guy, having a plain, cheap white T-shirt that fits this comfortably is a rare gift.

Some shrink a little, some a lot; some come fatastically large, some just right.  This is deffinatley true from pack to pack over the past two years, but it also seems true inside a three pack. Those that come just right are a blessing for a long torso'ed heavy guy like me, but with roughly 1/3 making the cut - it's hard to recommend this product.I'd like to also note that the price for xxxl long Ts shouldn't be multiples of the price for xxl long Ts.

Unless you consider wearing out after about 250 or more washings as not borderline perfect!This shirt, ordered in March of 2018 and worn 5 or 6 times since, including last week, is NOT comfortable and is very tight in the mid-section. This is the tall version and the length is super long -- probably 2 inches more than it needs to be. Some would say, \"no, that's what I want it to be...\" and I'll concede that to be the case as many of us like our shirts to stay tucked. That's why I got the Tall in the first place. So I won't ding the shirt's review over that, but just be aware: you may not need the tall version.However, other than having a tag that remains, the Comfort Colors line of shirts is superior in EVERY way to the Beefy T.

Unfortunately, there was a noticeable dip in quality; the necks on the new batch stretched out in weird ways, and they got holes in the armpits after only a few wearings/washings.

So, if you're contemplating buying this shirt but can't get passed the negative reviews I say, go for it, you'll never know unless you buy it.", "I\u2019ve been wearing Fruit of the Loom men\u2019s T-shirts for several years because they are plain and more comfortable and durable than the ladies shirts (I don\u2019t like the \u2018fitted\u2019 tops made for ladies, and the material is usually pretty thin). It was time for some new long sleeved shirts this winter, so I went for these. As always, super comfy, durable, and I got multiple colors so I can wear them every day of the week. For reference, I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d, 140lbs, with a 27\u201d waist and 36A bust, and I bought a Small (I also buy men\u2019s Smalls in Fruit of the Loom T-shirts and they are my go-to everyday shirts).", "I love these long sleeve t-shirts. I'm female and have a hard time finding t-shirts that are long enough for me. Although I am not that tall (5'5\"), most women's t-shirts tend to be short, thin and clingy.Pros: Fits as expected, long, quality fabric and stitching, wash well (I immediately take them out of the wash, do a quick 2 min. tumble with a wool dryer balls. I put a few drops of lavender essential oil one one ball.), and hang dry. I don't have any wrinkles. Long-lasting, and very comfortable.Cons: The shipping takes A LONG TIME! I ordered this pink one (med) 3 weeks ago and it just arrived yesterday. I've had the same snail shipping with other orders of the same shirts in different colors for me and my family. Hence the deducted star.I have no reservations in recommending these shirts. **I was NOT offered any incentive or freebie for my honest review.**", "Great shirts for the price !!  I bought these for my mother who is bed ridden.  We cut a slit straight up the middle of the back of the shirt to just below the collar line so that we can just slip it over her head and then insert her arms.  She loves them because they are so soft and comfy.  The long sleeves keep her warm in the winter and in the summer also due to the a/c.  They wash up nicely too.  I have even added a little bleach to them because she often gets coffee or food stains on them and with just a little bleach the stains come out, but the color stay intact.", "I have the same shirt from Target and Walmart that I've used and they are MUCH nicer quality and thicker than this. For a heavy cotton this shirt is incredibly thin. I wrote to the seller and never received any response in return regarding this matter. Really disappointing.", "I got this in a small as I'm 5'2\" and 110#.  The size is what I expected as I have tried the medium and it was way too long and the neckline too wide.  Even at my size, I find the body of the shirt snug in spots, but overall just fine.  I just stretch the shirt after washing to make it easier to get on.  IMO if you are a guy, I would size up at least one size, perhaps two.  After washing the length does shrink up a couple of inches.  I got my husband mediums in 2 of these shirts in  different colors and they are definitely too snug for him.  I like to wear the mediums as sleep shirts so no loss.  The colors I got (this one and another pink) are vibrant and nice.  They do fade with washing.  Overall I like the shirts and wear them a lot.", "Glad I got Lg.

I ordered a XL for my boyfriend because he likes them loose and that's the size he normally wears but this shirt is way too big and is very thin. I wouldn't recommend.

You'll forget you have them on. They feel super good against my skin. Unlike things like polypro underwear, I don't overheat and sweat in these. I wear them to bed, underneath other layers when hiking, and whenever I want an extra layer of warmth. They are very thin, and you might think they will be flimsy and not last... not at all the case, at least in my experience. They keep their shape too. I've put them through some tough trials too. I have yet to have one wear out on me. I send them through the washer and dryer with everything else. I bought both the men's and women's versions (same brand). In men's I need a size smaller that what I take in women's. The design is different, and the fabric used for the men's (this product) is thicker and a different knit pattern. I like the men's much, much better. So although the women's has held up just as well, I won't replace them. I'll just buy more of the men's design.", "Does its job fairly well. It doesn't add quite as much warmth as I was hoping; about as much as you would get from putting a t-shirt under whatever else you're wearing. Of course, it's a thin silk thermal shirt, so it's not meant to give that much added warmth. And if the wind is blowing and you don't have a jacket or something to block it, this won't help at all.However, it does provide some warmth and is very comfortable. It also doesn't collect body odor like a cotton t-shirt would, and it's very easy and simple to clean. I've rinsed it out in the bathroom sink in the evening before going to bed, hung it on a hanger or over a door, and it's completely dry by morning, ready for another day of silky warmth.", "I bought this Thermasilk shirt based on a lot of good reviews on Amazon, against my better judgement, because the closest REI is 300 miles away and I didn't want to pay REI's shipping charges. I should have just bit the bullet and paid them because this Thermasilk shirt won't last 1/2 as long as my existing REI brand silk layer shirt -- after 2 washings it is already starting to unravel.Does anyone remember women's silk stockings? Well, one of the big problems with them was that they would get \"runs\" which is what seems to be happening with this Thermasilk shirt. It's warm and comfortable,but fragile. It doesn't appear to be cheaply made (and it wasn't cheap in price either), the silk is just not holding up to the same \"very delicate\" washer settings as my 1.5 year old REI shirt. Maybe it's just a one-season wonder: a disposable shirt that only lasts one winter.", "I give it 4 stars, but only because I bought it \"off season\" when the price was *much* lower than it's been since mid-Fall. (That may explain the discrepancy between some of the reviews, too, since most reviewers don't mention what they paid for it.)  Mine was about ten bucks, in mid-September.  It's easily worth that price.  I bought one to try and left the item in the \"Saved for Later\" part of Amazon's shopping cart to buy more if I liked it, but by the time I'd thought to order more, the price had shot WAY up. (The same thing was true for the glove liners I bought, and the long johns I unfortunately did not buy the first time around.)As always, silk is *much* warmer than cotton and warmer than most wool, but that's as measured *by weight*.  This undershirt is warmer than a currently-common thin cotton undershirt, but no warmer than a heavier cotton T-shirt.  But is IS much thinner and more comfortable.  I especially like wearing it under a thinner pullover, where it provides adequate protection (for both my skin and the sweater) and a little extra warmth without visible bulk.  (I do wish they made them with a V-neck, though, since the collar is a tad high and tends to show around the neck of many of my sweaters.) The wrist cuffs are a bit on the loose side, but that's pretty typical of pure silk and I've always found this a common problem with long-sleeved silk undershirts, the fiber just isn't as springy as cotton and some types of wool.  A little lycra in the cuffs would be nice, but seriously, I wouldn't expect that sort of touch in anything but a very expensive shirt - WIntersilks don't have it either.  But at full price ($20s), I won't be buying more. (If/when prices go back down next Spring, I will stock up, however.)I don't own any recent-vintage Wintersilks, so I don't know how they're making *them* these days - the few pieces I have are all more than 20 years old.  (Living in NYC where it very rarely gets \"bitterly\" cold, I just don't have all that much use for them, though I have worn them regularly, if not frequently, every Winter for all that time.)  To be fair, not all of my Wintersilks have surived that long, but a few have, and I don't take special care of them.  They go in the warm/color wash and get dried in the drier.  I very seriously doubt, on the other hand, that this shirt will last 5 years, much less 20.  And since I can't be bothered with things like \"lingerie bags\" for the washer, am very unlikely to risk putting these through a regular wash cycle along with my other clothes.  The fabric isn't terrible.  It's not so much that the yarn seems much thinner than other silk undergarments', but the knit is definitely looser.", "Don't buy these expecting much thermal insulation, but they work great in chilly summers. I own probably 6 different types of terramar thermal's, and I love them all as they each have their place. These are really great for my summer hikes, when it may drop 55-65\u00b0. I usually don't bring a sleeping bag in theses temperatures, instead just a pair of these, the thermasilk pant, and maybe a lightweight bag liner.To compare these to the Terramar Silkweight (the next closest comparison in temp and weight) :* These are 100% pure silk.. Silkweight is 100% polyester* These are good down to 65\u00b0 by themselves ( wearing wicking shirt and maybe rain jacket ).. Silkweight is good closer to 55\u00b0 with the same.* These weigh 76g in Medium.. Silkweight weighs 140g in Medium.Other notes:* These are VERY comfortable to wear.* Silk feels great against your skin.* They are rather see through when stretched out over your sikn.* They don't stretch as well as other terramars obviously, because its pure silk.* They seem as durable as any other terramar. I've worn them out sitting on the ground by a fire, minor branch snags here and there, no rips or issues.If I had to come up with any con... I'd like to see a hybrid of the silk with a little polyester or spandex. Something between the weight of these and the Silkweights, that offered a little stretch that fits a bit better (or a bit more like the rest of terramars), and maybe offered a bit more warmth. Although it's not really a con as much as a wish for another product.These are great warm weather thermals though, that I will continue to use for many years.", "I should have heeded the other reviews that mentioned it's very thin.  I was hoping it would be like an older set I have but they must have changed it.  My older set is indeed thin and I like them for that reason, but they're not this thin.  I have used this and it works, but it is way too close to wearing hose-like material.  I would prefer something more durable.  I wish they would bring back the old style, which was a great compromise of thin enough to easily under clothes but not so thin that it's like hose. I am a woman but I ordered the men's style, hoping it would be more robust than the women's.  Nope.", "I have this in both \"natural\" and black, and you probably want to stick to the black as the natural is essentially see-through, especially if it gets sweaty. It is also absolutely not good as a running or hiking base layer as it hangs on to sweat and doesn't dry very quickly under another shirt. I'm keeping mine for use this winter, and I have no doubt they will be fine, but if I'd known they didn't like heavy exertion use, I would have stayed away from them. The 4 star rating is based on it's use as a standard cold weather base layer. As a running/fast hiking base layer, I would have to drop it to a 2.", "These are quite a bit thinner than I would have liked. Think very baggy support panty hose. However, they do provide some additional warmth. If I were going to wear a light jacket, these could be substituted.I was really seeking something that I could use for pajamas. I was originally attracted to the \"silk\" aspect of the product thinking that the fabric would not \"grab\" the sheets or bed covers as I moved in my sleep. They are more \"slick\" than cotton but probably not as suited in that aspect as what I would expect satin to be. Alas, I do not like loose bed clothing as it always seems to bunch up and twist around as I move around while sleeping. There is some of that with Thermasilk as well but that may be more due to the size I ordered than anything else. All in all, they are better than a cotton tee and long-john bottoms I had been using. I didn't dislike them enough to send the back but I doubt I will order them again.After reading the reviews, I decided to order the large size. In my case and for my use, the medium would have been better suited. I suspect that the size you prefer will depend on how you like your underwear to fit. Also, given that the Thermasilk product is very thin, a tighter fit might result in tears of the fabric.One last note on the thinness of the fabric. These really are about like panty hose. If you have rough hands, you can expect to cause a run in the fabric just from normal use. They are also going to require some special attention to launder. Probably hand washing", "Super thin material.  Meant as a sleeping base layer, preferably for backpacking  (hands down the best sleeping base layer on the market).  Must take accurate measurement before ordering, then go one additional size up...same for pants).  Too big will bunch up when sleeping.  Hardly notice it on when sleeping.  Wicks away moisture under down quilt.  Treat it right and it should last a long time.", "Hubby and I both got a set of these Thermasilk Filament layers for a Dec trip to NYC - these were perfect! These are thin, like slightly thicker than women's pantyhose, but that means that these easily fit under jeans and long sleeve tops.  We both felt warm enough to endure late nights in the chilly wind (with coats and scarves obviously) but didn't feel too bulky or hot. Sizing was true for both of us - not skin tight like spandex but not baggy either. You can bend your limbs just fine. These are great baselayers for walking a winter city, but not thick enough for really braving the elements."]},

It is cooler, comfortable and I like it. The color is good and matches the listing, the fit is just a tiny bit too small. It isn't too small to wear comfortably for me but it is just a little smaller than my favorite fitting shirts.The cut/fitment is good and I like it but it being just a bit small keeps it from being \"perfect\".

To those saying that they got an XL when they ordered a medium or an XXL etc. Please learn how to read. The shirt sizes are CHINESE. A Medium in the US is an XL in China where these shirts are made.

As a body builder I'm tired of shirts that hang off the chest thus making you look fatter. I don't even have a great chest yet there's so many shirts I own that I hate wearing because they hang off my chest.This shirt is great for bodybuilder/people into fitness. Shows off arms and chest very well.The down sides is that the shirt bunches up slightly in the stomach area and tends to not stay down. It's very minor and probably not even noticeable to anyone but yourself. However I find myself straightening it out often pulling down at the end of the shirt to straighten the wrinkles/bunched up parts around my stomach out. You can actually see what I'm talking about by looking at the model with the black shirt. This is the only reason I didn't give this 5-stars.Very minor and it's probably only a problem to me since I like shirts that completely cling to me."]},

Instead of getting those, I got dark blue, dark green, dark brown, and gray knockoffs. They are nothing like my original Alternative shirt and do not have any brand markings whatsoever. The construction is poor, with threads coming out of all the seams. The text behind the neck claims made in El Salvador, but it shipped from China and the care tag near the waist says Made In China. The text also claims \"100% cotton,\" which I doubt, though it is supposed to be 50 poly / 38 cotton / 12 rayon (which I verified that my old tee was).I'm incredibly disappointed; my original Alternative shirt had become one of my favorites and I was looking forward to getting more.Edit 2: was refunded by Amazon for the full purchase price, which was nice.

The Navy is a great shirt, although it is probably generous to called it \"navy\" colored. More like grey with a slight hint of blue in it. Love it anyway. Good material, soft, fits great.The other two, however... not so much. It took them a few weeks to get to me from overseas, no idea where from since the plastic package they came in didn't indicate such. The clear plastic that they were wrapped in had \"L\" on the outside, presumably indicating that they are size \"Large\", but they fit more like a small. Or maybe a child's large? Who knows. Impossible to tell because there is no tag inside the collar. Way too small for me to wear, regardless. Moreover, they seem to be made of a completely different material than the Eco Navy. Amazon's website lists that the shirts are all \"50% Polyester/38% Cotton/12% Rayon\". That seems on point for the Eco Navy. For the other two, however, it's like they made the whole shirt out of shiny polyester or something.The Eco Navy was fulfilled by Amazon, and the other two were fulfilled by \"Gene Jeffrey\".

I find t-shirts hard to find because of my thinner, athletic build.  They are usually too baggy or if I get an athletic fitting shirt, much too tight.  However, this t-shirt was exactly what I wanted.  It fits the upper body nicely, allowing you to show off your figure but without squeezing.  The tightness around the sleeves is also a nice fit. They do not squeeze your biceps but fit with a tightness that does not hide any work that you might have put into your bicep workout routine.  All in all, I would recommend this t-shirt if you are looking for something that shows off your figure without it being an athletic compression outfit.", "I purchase many Alternative tees for my husband and they fit well in his size which is mens small.

The size is pretty true, maybe just a tad bit wide.  It's a good thickness and not very see-through at all.  The material feels like it would be wonderful to wear under a button down dress shirt.", "I love the material of this shirt.  It is soft and has a bit of shine, but not so much that it looks overly formal.  The stretch makes movement easy and would allow a fitted shape, but the fit is slightly bulky.  I also like the density, which almost makes the nipples invisible, but not quite in good lighting. The more serious critique that would keep me from recommending this strongly is the way the material bunches up around the neck.  It just seems to get worse with cleanings.For an undershirt that will not be seen, I highly recommend this shirt.  It is bright white, covers body anatomy enough, and is very comfortable.  For a shirt you might want to wear alone or have the neckline exposed, there are probably better options.", "I'm quite happy with this simple, basic tee shirt.  The material is thin and light, but not see through at all.  It's also very stretchy, yet it's not tight fitting.  It's a great fit and slightly loose like a regular tee shirt.  I like the fit of the sleeves and the neck hole, which is not too large like some tee shirts I get.  It seems to be wrinkle resistant and fast-drying, so it will be great to take on a trip where I might need to wash it in a hotel sink.  I wish the label were printed instead of sewn on because you can see the stitching on the outside, but that's a nit-picky observation.  5 stars for a nice, basic tee shirt that feels and looks good.", "The look, feel and quality of this T-Shirt are nice, but it's on the looser side, looking and feeling kind of baggy.  I normally wear size large, but for a snug fit, medium actually works better for me.So...if you want it to fit quite loosely, order the proper size.

Otherwise, a nice T-shirt.  4 stars.", "Made in China, largely from cotton but with 5% elastane, and just a bit on the relaxed side, with a little more fabric than a standard Jockey t-shirt.

As a simple dude, I wear tons of crew neck t-shirts, both with and without breast pocket.  While this fits well and looks nice enough, the fabric is just strange.

{"asin": "B07KWKJC6R", "comments": ["I'm a frequent buyer on Amazon and I've shared my opinions on a variety of items over the years.  While most merchandise ordered is satisfactory, some items deserve special recognition and recommendation.  The Zecmos V Neck shirts meet my standards for special mention.  Note that I did not receive any compensation, product discount or free merchandise for this 5 star review.I'll get into sizing later but my reason for the elevated review is the quality of the shirts received.  I've included some photos of the overall appearance and detail of this item to illustrate the maker's attention to detail--it is exceptional.  The shirt itself is 100% cotton and is great for casual wearing or for gym use as I have intended.The texture is super soft and because its cotton, sweat will be wicked away from your skin thereby maximizing cooling and comfort. This shirt will accentuate your upper body especially if you've taken some time at the gym to develop your chest and upper arms.  All seams are well tailored and all sewing is finely applied and very tight.  Quality is high and certainly not typical for a shirt of this price.  The deep-cut \"V\" draws attention to your upper chest and gives you an strong athletic body taper.  And if you've worked on your upper arms, the sleeves (on the shorter side) will make your biceps \"pop\".  Ladies like the center chest V accent (or so I've been personally told) and it just has a masculine flair far above any standard tee shirt no matter the trademark.The sizing is the only problem with the shirt; not the shirt itself.  ORDER THE SHIRT 2 OR EVEN 3 SIZES LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD.  I for instance didn't fully read the description and ordered the shirt for my \"American\" frame rather than the Chinese sizing.  The shirts were just too small.  Finally, I ordered the XXXLarge instead of my usual Large and I'm a happy customer and will be buying more.So take a look at the attached photos and order one for yourself but REMEMBER 2 OR 3 SIZES LARGER AND YOU'LL BE PLEASED WITH YOUR LOOK.09/14/2018:  This shirt is blend of 50% cotton and 50% polyester, not 100% cotton as originally stated.", "The photos are misleading.

The fabric is soft.For anyone curious about sizing: I'm 5'8, 250 pounds (powerlifter build). I ordered the XL and it fits me well. It's a bit looser than I'd like, which might be important if you're smaller. My arms are 19 inches around and the sleeves are less snug than I'd prefer, so it's going to feel even less \"fitted\" if you are smaller.Overall it's a decent shirt, but the listing is misleading.", "NOTE: FITS AS EXPECTED ONLY BECAUSE I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE ORDERING!!  Normally i'm size L, or even XL (6' 190 lbs), but after reading reviews I went for the XXXL and it fits well.

Looking for something similar - tight, lightweight, stretchy, deep-v undershirt that can't be seen when i undo a button or two - and this gets the job done.  The shirts are longer in the back than the front, not really sure why, but it's not a big deal and stays tucked.

It is a little heavier fabric than his other Calvin Klein t-shirts, and he looks great in it!", "Calvin Klein has been hit or miss for me over the years in terms of fit, especially in sleeve length being shorter than I like, so I actually ordered one size larger than my normal shirt size (I wear medium and ordered a large).  I'm quite happy with my choice.  The sleeve length is totally acceptable and probably only about 1/4\" shorter than I prefer, and the rest of the shirt fits great.  It is a little loose, though, so if you like fairly short sleeves, then I think that ordering your regular size would be the right call.The great thing about the thinner fabric is that even with it being a little big on me, it doesn't really look it and certainly doesn't feel baggy at all.  It's extremely comfortable.  The fact that I don't notice it tells me that I like it a lot.  If I didn't like the look or the feel, I'd be self-conscious about it and wouldn't want it on me.The quality of the shirt is top notch.  I can't recall any CK clothing that I didn't feel the same way about.  Shirts, undershirts, boxers, everything.  They make good clothing.  I just don't love the super short sleeves on some of their shirts, but this one works for me being one size larger than my normal size.I also like the the \"ck\" logo on the front of the shirt (at least in Cadet Blue) is extremely subtle.  I don't feel like a billboard for them :), but it still shows off the brand.This is a great shirt that I also think is a good value at the current price of just over $20.  I usually pay ~$15 for my t-shirts, and they've all held up pretty well over the years, but they aren't in this same class of comfort or quality.", "My husband has purchased Calvin Klein T-Shirts periodically throughout the years, usually when they were on sale. Let\u2019s face it, they are pricey and this one is no different. In terms of quality though, CK T-shirts were always the gold standard in terms of good fit, so my husband understood why they were so costly. This Calvin Klein Short Sleeve Crew Neck Jersey Tee definitely has a lot of high quality points, but as my husband noted, it\u2019s not quite the same as the CK t-shirts he\u2019s had before.In terms of the positives, the shirt fits perfectly, is soft and comfortable, and looks very flattering on him. My husband said that there is something about the design and cut of CK t-shirts that make them look so good on people. This shirt is also well stitched and the Cadet Navy color is a deep and rich navy blue that looks very attractive.As for the negatives, the issue my husband noticed about this shirt versus his older CK T-shirts is that the fabric feels much thinner. The material is still a soft and smooth 100% cotton, but feels less substantial than his older CK shirts. My husband said that it was as if CK made a summer weight version of their original t-shirt shirt. So if you like CK t-shirts and want one that is thinner and lighter weight for warm weather, then this is absolutely the shirt for you. But for my husband, who is used to the original version, this issue combined with the usual high price tag, made it difficult for him to give this attractive shirt more than 4 stars.", "I've owned CK tees in the past, and I had very positive memories of them--definitely a notch or two above a typical tee.  So, my expectations were high, yet I can say without reservation that this tee exceeded even my lofty expectations in several regards:+ Fine Fabric: Amazingly high quality fabric with body, impeccable knit, deep black color, and premium look.  There is no mistaking this for any ordinary T-shirt.  It arrives pressed to the 9's, and you may want to press it after washing it to make it look just as stunning every time you wear it.+ Super Flat Seams: The tailoring of this shirt is exquisite--seams so flat you will be shocked.  No comparison to typical seams found on ordinary tees.  This is like dress shirt tailoring.+ Subtle CK Embroidery: The left pectoral muscle area of the shirt has an embroidered CK logo in black thread--subtle, but upscale look.+ Small Exterior Calvin Klein Tag: The seam on the left side of the shirt, near the belt line has a small, not gaudy, Calvin Klein tag.  Again, it's a classy touch to a shirt you will love.+ Slim Fit with Stretch: I wear slim fit in everything.  This shirt fits perfectly, and it includes 3% Elastane (97% cotton) stretch to make it comfortable whatever you are doing while wearing it.Even if your son's name is not Calvin, like mine, you will love this shirt.  I'd recommend it to anybody.", "I noticed the size chart is for dress shirts. I'm a solid XL and the XL fits perfectly. It's a snug, elastic shirt, not as tight as a base layer/long underwear, but still snug.  Skin tight - but very comfortable. It feels like you're not wearing anything.  The neck-line is a smaller crew-neck and elastic. It STAYS in place.  The length is perfect.This really is one comfortable T-shirt, lightweight but not cheaply made. A typical lightweight T feels cheap. This does not. The CK logo is black on black and very subtle.If you like a snug fit, stay true to size. If you like a looser fit, go one size up.", "Made in Vietnam from 100% cotton, this t-shirt has the feel of a technical sport t-shirt, smooth and soft. The fabric is a little more sheer than that of a standard Jockey t-shirt and the overall fit is more for the slender/slim individual than for others, with sleeves that are just a little shorter than those of a standard t-shirt. It's well constructed, with extra stitching around the collar, and should last a long time. There's a subtle embroidered \"ck\" logo on the left chest, with black stitching on the black t-shirt that is not obvious unless you're looking for it. This is a t-shirt you can easily wear either on its own or with a jacket on top. Think Steve Jobs with a pair of jeans to go along and this is on the right track.", "This shirt costs quite a bit more than basic colored cotton T-shirts. What do you get for the price difference. You do get a small embroidered \"CK\" logo on the chest, but it is small and very subtle (unlike the huge gaudy Calvin logos on many of their garments). The fabric of this shirt is lightweight, but very finely woven and looks and feels great. Unlike the boxy cut of cheap T-shirts, this one is tapered from the chest down to the waist so it doesn't bind when you move your arms but does flap around your torso either. Sizing is large compared to some other American brands. I weigh 160 pounds and size medium (my normal size) is loose on me. Actual chest size of the size medium shirt is about 44 inches at the widest.", "If you're a man or have a man in your life who lives in Tshirts, I would highly recommend this Calvin Klein Tshirt. The quality can be immediately seen and felt. Its very soft and a little bit thicker than your average cotton Tshirt without being too heavy or warm. It has a nice amount of stretch so that it retains its shape after multiple washes and wearings. It fits a little closer to the body but is not too snug or slim fitting. It has the look of a tailored T made to fit your body, never looking sloppy. This is the kind of Tshirt a man could pair with a sport jacket in order to dress it up. Its exactly what you would expect from a designer like Calvin Klein!", "I\u2019ve always loved Calvin Klein clothing. The designs are always so modern and elegant, even on a t-shirt. It\u2019s all in the detailing. From the discretely embroidered logo on the left side to the Calvin Klein tag near the hem, and the double fabric on the back that is framed the neckline (I looked online for what that is called but came up empty). The shirt is a deep navy, it almost looks black, and fits to a (dare I say it) T! The cotton is very smooth and combed, almost like their \u201cLiquid Cotton\u201d fabric, but not quite as smooth and silky. This is a great T, I highly recommend it!", "It's hard to believe that this is 100% cotton--it's so soft and has great give.  The XL fits well and looks good on.  The only issue with the fit is that the sleeves are too short--maybe a half-inch to an inch too short.  My husband can still wear it, no problem.  He says it just feels a little unusual, compared to all his other T-shirts.  (Maybe I should buy him more of these, so that these become the norm....)The seams and the finishing work are really well done.  The tiny CK emblem is very discreet.  Washes well on normal-warm and dries well on low heat."]},

Shirts would be even more excellent if darker/drab colors (other than baby blue and light grey) that don't attract biting/stinging insects were also offered on the back materials for night time use in hot climates. Stain resistance decent, could be better but that's very minor considering the every and all day fishing use I've put these through.

Alas, the shirt itself didn't really live up to my expectation.

The shirt appears to be well made and stitched very well. It has a tapered fit that hugs your body the whole way. It will look better on a slim fellow. I received a large size but I would have preferred a X-Large. As with other Calvin Klein clothing, I have found them to be a tad on the small size.The shirt looks good on me with a black T under it and the buttons open. It also looks good with no T under it. Either way it is a nice looking shirt that doesn't look cheap.The material is 100% cotton and wrinkle resistant. Mine comes out of the wash with little to no wrinkles. I have hung it on a hanger to air dry and it is ready to wear. I have not needed to take an iron to it.In conclusion, this is a very nice looking shirt with a tapered fit. It washes well and maintains its appearance after. It is cut a bit on the small size and I would suggest getting a size bigger than your normal size.

It is more casual than dressy but will be just right for your next party appearance or gallery opening.

The only thing I will warn you about is the sizing. The cut of the shirt is slim or athletic and has fitted/tapered sleeves, so it fits a little small. My husband normally wears an XL but thought that it was too small for him, so he passed it along to my son, who wears a L. It fit him perfectly. So, you might need to order up to make sure it fits.

On the other, there was some plastic thread or hard spot that constantly dug into my neck with incessant irritation. I shaved at the area, plucked it, washed it several times to no avail.

This review will talk about the colors, the fit and matching to your bra.Colors: The white was a bit more see-through than I was hoping. It didn't show my bra, but it did show the line of my pants. So it isn't super thin, but I wish it was just a bit more opaque. And the red is not a deep red, but a super bright orangy red. So if you want a bright red - this red is for you. But if you are hoping for a darker/deeper red, like you see in the photo, then I would pass on the red.Fit: I read in other reviews to size up.  I am normally a L or XL. (6' tall, size 12-14) So I bought the red in XL and I liked the fit. I also bought the white in XL and XXL. I don't think I have ever purchased an XXL before because they are normally huge, but I wanted the white to be \"flowy\" over my belly. This XXL in white was not overly huge and did float over my belly in a nice way - and at 6' tall it was perfectly long enough. But I could see it being too long on someone else.Bra: I choose white and red shirts because I have white and red bras - and I figured that the bra strap would coordinate nicely with the shirt. So, when deciding which color shirt to buy, you may want to think about your bra. Plan that the strap will show and you may want to match the bra and shirt - or wear a strapless bra.In sum - this shirt is cute and at a great price!

I got these to wear at night with pajama pants or in the morning with leggings.But these are perfectly wonderful if you like to wear a t-shirt with your jeans, although the white might be a bit too see-through, as white garments often are.  I'm happy to report that I love the soft, slinky, stretchy, comfortable material. I'm also happy to tell you that it's almost exactly like a J.Jill white t-shirt I bought years ago, and of course J.Jill never made one like it since then. It's the same cut, same fabric, and quality of stitching. And of course this one is far less expensive and doesn't have a pocket like the J.Jill.

The white shirt is transparent to the point of being inappropriate when worn alone and would need to be worn as a layer. That said, there are several redeeming qualities for this shirt. The first is that they make an excellent undershirt and are very thin and breathable for that purpose.

Unless you\u2019re just looking to make sure you don\u2019t flash someone as you\u2019re bending over because, obviously, this has a low neckline.", "Great shirt for the fall!

I like my shirts to be larger and flowy, this shirt fits true to size and is flattering on my cury shape", "This shirt is super cute! Only negatives I would point out is you\u2019re definitely going to need an undershirt with this one and the ties are a little bit confusing. I\u2019m usually a small/medium and I ordered a small in this. I get that the style is oversized. But it was almost too oversized to where it would\u2019ve been ill fitting.... on the plus side it\u2019s easy to style and great for layering and the waffle knit is great quality.", "This Top is so so Cute! As soon as I tried it on my Husband told me how good it looked! Super Soft and High Quality! I really like that it\u2019s a little longer in the back to help cover the Butt a little bit! So glad I was able to save some $$$ This would of been Double the Price if I would of bought at a Local Boutique!", "I wish I had sized up! But I love this top. Everything about it is on trend. The buttons, the tie front and the waffle fabric. The \u201crust\u201dColor is almost a mauve color. A little more purple than red but a nice subdued color for fall. The medium fits me just fine, but to get that slouchy, oversized look I would have needed to size up.", "Love this top! Took a couple of weeks to arrive though. I typically wear a medium but decided to order a size up and I'm glad I did, the large is perfect to tie in front (like the picture) and covers about half my tush (I like to wear leggings). For reference I am 5' 2\", 150 lbs, 38DD.", "I definitely got this in a size bigger than what I normally wear. First thing is it feels amazing! I got the white color and I love the color. Second is its suppose to tie in the front but theres not much to tie with which im fine with. Third is theres gaps in between the buttons which opens because of my boobs. I ordered a larger size expecting it to be super oversized and it wasn\u2019t which makes me believe it has a smaller fit. Other than all of that I like it.", "At first I was a little disappointed.  But then it grew on me after I wore it. I'm 5'11 and got the XL. Sizing is always tough for me because of my height. The sleeves are looser than I would like (but again it's an XL) over all I really like it and the back is still longer in the back for me. It's a great price compared to the boutiques.", "This top is very soft, light, and comfortable. I ordered the \u201crust red\u201d color in a small and it is pretty perfect size wise for me. For reference I am 5\u20192\u201d 135lbs. I didn\u2019t want it to be skin tight since I like to tuck the front of my shirts in. I have no intentions to tie the front as pictured so I will be happy to tuck the two front pieces into my jeans. My only complaints are that 1. It will probably snag easily. And 2. The buttons are pretty spaced out (a cami can fix this and I always wear a cami under my shirts so no big deal). Someone else mentioned that the button holes were hard to find and I kind of laughed when I read that wondering how it\u2019s hard to find a button hole?! I get it now. They arent outlined with thread it\u2019s just a hole cut in the shirt so you kind of have to check for them.", "I honestly can't believe how much I love this super-cute top!

So much so, you can forget you're wearing it!I wore it travelling to the TCI and it looked fresh and felt fluid and soft at my destination.  It's not the dressiest of tops but for casual wear, it's a good buy, and a jacket dresses it up sufficientlyThis washes easily and DRIES QUICKLY.  I used it as a pajama top in a pinch and it made a cool sleep top, too.I plan on buying more in various colours.The top falls at hip length, making it flattering and versatile for many body types.  It runs a tad large perhaps but not overly so.The colour-blocked pocket detail makes this top stand out from dozens of other nondescript tops in one shade only.Similar tops LOOK lightweight but are surprisingly heavy to pack but this casual shirt is light and rolls up neatly in a suitcase or carry-on.Good buy, this.  Love it.Thank you for taking the time to read this review.  I hope it's been of help to you.", "I am 5'2\" , 135 pounds, 32DDD bra size, I ordered a medium and I love how it fits! It is not tight at all, flowy but doesn't make me look pregnant. Super cute! Nervous because it says dry clean only but hopefully washing it on delicate works out!", "I ordered a size up. The shirt is very nice quality! Almost feels silky! Wearing it for a photo shoot !", "This shirt is awesome!  I received so many compliments when I wore it!  The fit was perfect.  I can usually wear a size S or M, but I chose the M based on other reviews and because I wanted a looser fit.  The fabric is so soft and comfortable.  It washes well and doesn't wrinkle.  I dried the shirt on low heat after the first wash and high heat after the second (because I forgot), and it didn't shrink at all.  The shirt is perfect to wear with jeans for a casual look or to dress up with black pants.  The v of the neckline doesn't dip too low to show cleavage, and the white fabric isn't see-through, so there's no need for a cami underneath.  I highly recommend this shirt.  I would definitely buy this brand clothing from this seller again.", "Cute top and soft material. It is loose fitting like I wanted and it works tucked in or not.

It's a little shear so I'll probably wear a cami under it but that's no biggie because I usually do anyway. I love that it is flowy at the bottom like the picture shows.

Would def buy again in diff colors!", "Comfy and cute. I'm 5'9\" and 165lbs (carrying a little baby weight in my tummy) and I bought a large. I wanted it loose but still a good fit, and it's perfect. The shoulders and sleeves fit nicely and then it falls nicely. Covers the booty too. Soft and slinky - love it.", "Love it! It looks exactly like the picture. It's a super cute casual shirt. Good material and breathable."]},
{"asin": "B078SLP5P1", "comments": ["This is a good, high quality, casual shirt. The fabric is soft and feels well made. I purchased the Apricot color. It is more of a warm, soft, golden yellow than it appears in the photo. It is a beautiful color. The fabric is a bit thin, and see-theough, so I need to wear a camisole under. I wish it were thicker, but that is my only complaint.", "I purchased this because I have been looking for tops that have REAL fabric in them.  Most women's tops have polyester, nylon, rayon, acrylic, spanx and other names the industry have created to call fabric that's not fabric.  These are petroleum-based manufactured fibers.  This top is not 100% petroleum but it, in my research of looking for ones with more real fabric this worked.  It's 97%cotton, 3%spandex but that 3% gives the top a lot of stretch.Another reason I purchased this is I was looking for a top that breathed.  The fake fabric tops don't allow the skin to breath and hold in body heat.  Not a god thing if you a warm bodied person or for women experiencing hot flushes of flashes.  I wore this shirt for the first time yesterday and it was comfortable.  I didn't get overheated or feel like the fabric was sticking to my skin.  However it is still cold here so I'll have to wait and see.  The top is plenty stretchy with jut 3% spanex.  Things I like about the top:Pros:The color:  The colors are vibrant and clear, not muted.The Cut:  The cut is tapered, not hanging like a tent like many of today's top.Less Spanx: This allows the top to be more relaxed and not fit like a second skin.The Cut: The scoop neck is not too revealing.The Cut: I like the length.  On me it's tunic length because I ordered the x-large.The Cut: Sleeve cut is nice.Cons:The Spanx:  Even though it's only 3% it could easily be less and have the same wearing experience.Fabric: It fits well but once the fabric settles it relaxes and become larger-that's because of the cotton which has a tendency to stretch out.The Fit: True to size?  What does that mean anymore?  There is a standardized size chart on most websites but there is no consistency in fit. I have ordered from Amazon clothes according to the size charts only to send them back because they didn't fit for one reason or another.  IMHO true to size means how do you want it to fit?  When I order more of this top I will order the large, but only because if I go smaller I'll lose the length I like.I would recommend this top.", "This fit great and form fitting.  I usually wear a large but ordered a extra large because of my DD cups.  The shirt stops right below the buttocks and I have a small waist with nice size hips.  I will definitely be ordering this shirt in other colors.", "I'm 5'11\" with very broad shoulders and a long torso. I recently had a baby and ordered an XL to fit my shoulders and be sightly loose over my midsection. I can also easily nurse in this shirt if that matters to anyone. This shirt is amazing! I've never loved a T-shirt this much. It's so soft and it's long, which is hard for me to find. I love this. I'm going to buy more for sure.", "I really like these blouses.  They are lightweight and nice looking.  The colors are very pretty too.  I like that the shirts are long, which is nice for people who want to detract attention from their mid-section.  I especially like the scoop neck.  I find that most T-shirts come up too high and if you are large-busted, they will just make you look fat.  The scoop neck on these pulls away from the neckline enough that it creates a really nice shape and hags well on the body.The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because the material is so light and delicate that I would recommend hand washing and hanging to dry rather than running them through a machine if you really want them to last.  On the other hand, the shirts are very inexpensive, so replacing them may not be an issue for you.  I definitely recommend.", "The first one I ordered was red in xxl.  I usually get xxl in tees because I have natural 36DDs and don't always want to have guys staring, especially at work which is where I intend to wear these.  However, the xxl was very boxy.  Pretty color, but \u2b1b.  So I figured I'd go down a size even though the difference between the xl and xxl is bigger than the difference between any of the other sizes, a 9\" difference versus a 3\" difference.  Thankfully, the xl, this time in burgundy, fits ok, not too tight in the chest so I won't feel self-conscious at work.  The red is a very vibrant and bold shade, while the burgundy has depth and warmth.  The material is soft but has weight, not that thin tissue paper-like material, and in those colors is not see-thru.  The seams are even and trim.  The shirts do come out of the dryer a little wrinkled, but that may be because I dry my clothes on \"no heat\" so they last longer.  Hanging them on hangers helps get rid of some of the wrinkles but if you fold your tees, you'll likely have a very wrinkled shirt.I intend to get more in the burgundy (for work) and some of the other colors (just cuz), in xl.", "I'm very casual and have been replacing shirts with more simple tops as my older ones have worn out. I ordered 2 of these and loved the fit so much that I ordered more. The top is form-fitting but still flattering on me. The top goes down to the top of my thigh (I am 5'5, 178 lbs and an hourglass shape). I probably could have gone a size down to a Large, but wasn't sure if it would end up too tight across my D-cups.  The shirt is easy to dress up or down depending on the occasion. Have and would repurchase!", "super comfy!  Nice &amp; long.  will purchase again &amp; think I need a L vs XL.  I am 5'1\" &amp; 140lbs", "These are a great fit. They don't cling in the underarm area and are not skin tight. I am 5'4\", 170 pounds (37ish inch waist, for reference), and I ordered the large. Not tight, and not super flow-y. I would say I am a large size in most tank tops/t-shirts, so definitely order the size that you would usually get unless you want it especially tight/loose. The colors are great and I saw no loose threads upon taking them out of the package.", "First off, if you are a person of average arm length, ignore the rest of this review and just know that this is a really nice, basic shirt.  The quality is good, the sizing seems normal, and the fabric is a nice weight and feel that looks like it should hold up to long-term wear really well.Okay, are they gone?  Right, the rest of this review is for those folks out there who, like me, have monkey arms and are constantly on quest for long enough sleeves.  Folks, I'm sad to say that this shirt is not the answer you are looking for.It seemed promising at first.  I have a long torso as well as long arms, and when I pulled the shirt on, not only did the fitted waist area actually fall at my waist (as opposed to somewhere around my ribcage as so often happens) but the hem hits right at the widest part of my hips, so I could bend and sit in this without any unwanted exposure.  Nice!  But alas!  When I tugged the sleeves down, they hit an inch above my wrist; after a bit of wear, I found that their natural ride-up position had them falling a full two inches short of my wrist.So if you are long in the arm and torso, I'd definitely consider the short-sleeved version of this shirt, but skip the long-sleeve version."]},

Sending it back.", "The material is super soft. I\u2019m usually a large but I ordered an XL since I like tees a little loose. I could have gone with the large because the fit is loose. The material is thin and will show curves. For that reason I\u2019ll be wearing it with a light shaping cami to smooth problem areas.", "I generally wear a large so that\u2019s what I ordered.

The blue is your standard navy.The material is on the thicker side, so i plan on saving the shirts for the end of summer/fall.

I ordered this in xsmall after looking at the photos and other reviews. 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating but that wasn't an option so I bumped it up instead of down due to the nice fabric.The bad: It does my figure NO favors. I don't like tight t shirts but ones that just have a little bit of shape that hint at there being a female form underneath and not a cardboard box. Unfortunately this tshirt gives me a \"shoebox\" body shape. I've attached a photo of how it hangs naturally vs when I pull it back at the waist so show how my body is actually shaped. If it was just tapered in around the waist even a tad more I'd be much happier with the silhouette.The good : It's SUPER SOFT. Extremely comfortable. The sleeves are the perfect length in my opinion. The neckline is also perfect for a casual tshirt. Not constricting at all but not flashy either. Great length. I'm wearing a nude bra underneath in my photos and I could not see it at all through the shirt. It has a nice thickness, but as you can see at the bottom you can see my shorts through it so don't expect to be able to wear a black bra without noticing it.All in all I think I will keep these as \"around the house\" shirts since they are affordable and so comfortable. If you want a nice weight, soft, non-sheer tee and don't care about it having any shape whatsoever, then it's a great option.", "I absolutely love them. I had read a lot of reviews, but I was still genuinely surprised at the quality of the material as soon as I opened the package. The material has some weight to it - doesn't feel cheap, thin or flimsy at all, and is soft to the touch. Be warned though on hot humid days it'll really cling to you if you're sweating a lot.The fit is perfect for what I wanted. I ended up getting the xxl because I wanted it to be huge on me and it did not disappoint - it goes well past my hips and fits very loose. I wanted something that was comfortable to do some working out in and lounging in and these turned out to be perfect. The color is absolutely beautiful as well.

I'm 5'5 140 lbs and 34B and the medium fit loose and was just too boxy for me, I'm going to reorder in small to see if it's a more flattering and feminine fit.  The fabric is nice and light, not too spandex-y like workout tops.  As to the white being see through- I was wearing a nude bra and could not see it, however the waistband of my black pants was clearly visible through it, so if that sort of thing bugs you these probably wouldnot bee good for you. They were long (mid hip), but I personally like alittle extra coverage over my hips especially with skinny jeans. The fit of these really reminded me of Old Navy - the vanity sizing kings of retail.  I always get size small in tops there, if that helps anyone.", "The material is soft and not thin - two important qualities I look for in a casual T.  I like the round-neck slightly better than the 'v' only because the latter tends to stretch in the collar a little.  I recommend sizing down if you have a smaller chest; otherwise, order the size you would normally get.", "These shirts are a really great deal - much thicker and higher quality than I was expecting! There's even some stretch to the fabric. The length is slightly long - not quite enough to cover my butt like a tunic, but still a skosh longer than most of my other t-shirts, which might be nice for people with longer torsos (For reference, I'm a little over 5'4). As for sizing, I'm a pretty solid L-XL in shirts, but as I like my t-shirts to fit a little looser I went for an XL here and they fit just how I wanted, so I'd say these are true to size.

I personally didn't care for the style and cut for my current body shape and size. I am largely built, but more or less proportional with a large chest, so I prefer a-line tops that hug the chest and have a gentle taper down to the waist.

I'm sorry I purchased it.", "After reading reviews to go a size up I ordered a large. I\u2019m usually a shmedium. 5\u20194 125. Large fits PERFECT. I bought these to wear under scrubs but they are perfect for casual wear too. My fabric isn\u2019t as thin as others described I think it\u2019s a little warm/perfect bc I\u2019m a cozy queen. Very happy with my purchase ! Will order again in deferent colors. Was delivered really quick. Happy happy", "I am between a small and a medium normally, but after reading several reviews I decided to go with the large. Most said I should go with a medium but seeing the pictures of other buyers and how they looked I decided to go with the large. I love the fit of this shirt. The material is perfect, it is 8% spandex and 92% cotton. I like the extra spandex in the shirt because it makes it more stretchy and holds the shape. The length of it is a little longer, which I love, the bust firs perfect, and the sleeves have a little extra length at the end which I also like very much. I recently went from 163 pounds to 125 pounds. My bust is a 36D, my waist is a 31.5, and my hips are 37 inches. I ordered the gray and charcoal. The charcoal looks a little like purple to me which is what I wanted. I am going to buy more of these shirts.", "Great light weight shirts! Perfect for layering and we just what I was looking for to wear under sweaters, vests, etc. They are soft and feel nice. I am 5'2\", 123lbs, 34C and bought a size L after reading the reviews. Glad I did! The L fits great, slightly snug on the chest. Only a small amount of shrink after the wash. Nice and long - both sleeve length and waist. The only reason for not 5 stars was the sizing was off.  Overall happy with this purchase and would buy them again!"]},

Instead of this bra I would recommend:Maidenform Comfort Devotion Demi (both Embellished and not)Maidenform Smooth ComfortWarner's Your BraIf you like some extra padding (not as in push up, just a little extra in the cup bottom) Maidenform Natural Boost Demi is very nice.All of the above are much softer all over - the cups, the straps, the band. Compared to them this bra feels somewhat stiff.", "I wouldn't even give this bra a star if I didn't have to. I don't understand. I bought this exact same bra a year ago and it was amazing. I opened up my package today and this bra is thin, flimsy, and cheap looking. It's not even really nude it's like a white nude. What happened? Please send me a new one that is better so I can update this review. Bc I really do love Maidenform. But this bra was extremely disappointing. And frankly a waste of money.", "I bought the white bra before a trip and it fit PERFECTLY. Most comfortable bra I've worn. I loved it so much I bought one in black from the same seller, in the same size. I was incredibly disappointed by the black bra. Both items have the same description and brand (Maidenform one fab fit t-shirt bra), and yet if you look at the photos I submitted there is a HUGE size discrepancy. Both are supposedly 36DD, and yet the band on the black bra is an entire 1.5 inches shorter! I am going to need to exchange the black for a longer band unfortunately. Also the fact that the labels are completely different for the same model makes me wonder about the authenticity of the brand. One is made in Bangladesh, the other in El Salvador. One has (R) by the brand name (white bra) and the other (TM/MC) (black bra) which leads me to believe the black one is a knock-off.", "Giving 3 stars due to inconsistent sizing. The one bra that did fit gets 5 stars. I was delighted to see these here after buying one at a store. I ordered black, blush, Moroccan blue, and beige. Sadly, only the Moroccan blue bra fit perfectly like the one I bought in store. The others were made of different materials that were not as comfortable and the bands were actually much shorter (I'm talking 1-2\" difference). I would have needed to use those extenders at the biggest setting to be able to wear them, so I returned the 3 that were unbearably tight. The Amazon refund was speedy and return shipping was indeed free, so those were pluses. It's unfortunate that the sizing is so inconsistent because when you do happen upon one that actually fits as it should, these are really comfortable.", "Maidenform style #7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape.  I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price.  I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store.  This new style is an oddly molded half bra that doesn't look natural under clothing - creating points where there shouldn't be any.  I've worn the same size and style for many years, and this product did not live up to the standard.", "Yes, it fits well and looks good but one of the two bras I ordered was too scratchy to wear- threads were bunched up in the back strap at one place which made it unbearable after a few hours of wear. When I went to return this bra (and keep the other), I discovered that not only was there no free return shipping but that there is a \"15% restocking fee\" that makes the bra not worth returning.", "I bought this in the black with the heart print.  I bought the Maidenform women\u2019s natural boost Demi bra (different style) at the same time. Comparing the two,  this bra is much more cheaply made then the natural boost demi bra.  The bra fit perfectly, and the print is cute. However, the fabric doesn\u2019t feel as silky as the natural boost Demi bra by Maidenform.  The sides of this bra are not lined, but the natural boost Demi bra is. They are both about the same price. I am going to return this one and get another natural boost Demi bra. One upside to this bra is that it has minimal padding, so it feels very natural. The natural boost Demi bra has a little bit more padding, but not too much in my opinion. But when I put on the other bra, it felt luxurious. When I put on this bra, it felt cheap.Another bra I bought at the same time that feels luxurious and has the more subtle padding like this bra is the Calvin Klein demi bra. It it lovely and about the same price as well. All from Amazon!", "I recently discovered I was wearing the wrong bra size. I never understood how women could be so unaware of something so crucial, but I, too, was way off. I was wearing a 36B, switched to a 36C, and presto -- the urge to rip off my bra and throw it across the room was gone!I cherish bras that disappear under my clothing and are good for all-day wear, and these fit the bill quite nicely. The straps are easily adjusted -- just move the little adjuster forward on the strap toward the cup, and the strap lengthens. I have a wide, strong torso, and this accommodates it beautifully.I first bought a beige and black one, and recently added the python patterned one to my brassiere collection. I tend to hand wash my bras, so I cannot speak to how these bras' cups hold up in the washing machine. I do own products that encapsulate bras in the wash so their shape is maintained, and I've had luck with those, so purchase one if you are concerned (I think I have a \"Bra Buddy\" -- picked it up at the State Fair of Texas years ago). Also, they break in easy rather than remaining stiff for a time like some DKNY and Calvin Klein bras do (and I ADORE CK bras after I wear them for awhile, but it's a fact -- their bras' bands are not always as malleable as I'd prefer). After the second or third time wearing it, it feels like it's always been your bra. I appreciate the lack of needless lace and silly embellishments that only make it lumpy under my clothing.I'll be checking back to see if more patterns in size 36C come back in stock. I am extremely satisfied. No longer do I groan when I have to put it on in the morning, nor do I immediately remove it as I leave work and begin my commute home.", "First of all this is the first time since I can remember that I really do have a need for a bra. I have been very, very \u2018small\u2019 and could get away with wearing just a camisole under a top (sometimes not even that). For years I used to hate wearing a bra, perhaps it was a result of my not buying the correct size and style. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d and about 103 pounds - give or take a couple and do need some coverage on the top. This style was the first one I tried and I used the sizing that was given to find my correct size (34C). I didn\u2019t realize it was an underwire bra but when I tried it on the wire didn\u2019t even feel uncomfortable. I liked this bra style so much that I bought several additional ones (all in basic colors like black, white, nude, navy). The style is cut low and I guess that\u2019s the reason it\u2019s called a t-shirt bra. The shoulder straps are adjustable and the clasp in the back has 3 different positions, depending on how \u2018wide\u2019 you need it to be (for me I was most comfortable with it on the first clasp, making it the widest). I won\u2019t even say how much (or how little!) these cost - at least when I bought them. There isn\u2019t anything that I would consider negative and would definitely recommend this style for everything, not only t-shirts!", "Cute bra.  Love the polka-dots.  I ordered it to replace a similar Maidenform model which I could not find in the correct size.  This bra is slightly smaller in fit than the other slightly different models I was replacing and that I ordered at the same time.  Both the band and the cups are smaller than expected, but not so much that I can't wear it.  Although it won't be my favorite."]},

The black stripe nursing top's label matches what is written on Amazon and this blue one does not.  I read Chinese so I understand what's on the labels.

The blue is a really pretty color. Vibrant and just like the picture.  I like that the underneath part is like a v-neck tank, it makes for easy access.  As some others have mentioned, the underneath stretches a bit over the course of the day, but it bounces back after washing (cold) and drying on low heat.  The material also tends to wrinkle a bit as you keep lifting the top to nurse. This doesn't really bother me though since its nicer than any other nursing shirts I've gotten.  Wish I could return all of the other nursing shirts I'd bought previously and only buy from smallshow.  Small fits great (5 ft 4, 115, 34DD). Sizing seems pretty consistent across the brand.

However it seems like even when I do fit in it, it is still meant to be way above the belly button. I was under the impression it would come down just above it if not on my belly button. So be advised this is indeed a small and tight crop top. It surprisingly fit my arms but not in a flattering way. If you're not a chubster like me you should be fine. Lol but it is small and a tighter material.", "It\u2019s like a silk material and i wish it was more like cotton. I ordered large because reviews made me nervous on sizing.

If you have a big chest possibly size up if you\u2019re worried of being too revealing. The tie up portion is also a little awkward.

I got this exact pair (color and size) several years ago from the TOMS website and wore them out so much, I thought it was finally time for a new pair (see picture). Unfortunately, at this point in my life, $50 plus shipping for a pair of shoes is just not in the budget, no matter how much I love them and how much use I will get out of them. I really do like the TOMS company, and would love to support them, but cannot afford it. Here I go to Amazon to find one for PRIME and only $35!! Seriously the most comfortable pair of shoes I own; I wear them all summer long.  As you can see from the photo, I get A LOT of use out of them, and they've held up wonderfully through the abuse I've put them through (several vacations, water rides, college campus walking, a puppy chewing them, working outside in the garden, and many many many steps). Will definitely recommend TOMS to anyone!!", "I have had these shoes for less than a month and they are absolutely destroyed!  I guess the chambray fabric just isn't sturdy enough!  The shoes are super comfortable but I'm going to go back to canvas TOMS from now on.  Incredibly disappointing!", "TOMS are always difficult for certain people to wear. I don't have narrow feet but I have a high discomfort tolerance when it comes to my feet in new shoes. I know that with TOMS, it normally takes them a week before my feet feel comfortable in them. Once they stretch out a bit, I can honestly wear these day and night. They're not meant for hiking, rainy weather, beaches, etc. so if you use them all the time, they will most certainly wear out quickly. I use them for running errands, shopping, walking around town, etc. and they have lasted me at least a year before needing replacement (and that was with me getting caught in the rain with them several times). I'm always a size 6 in TOMS (about half a size smaller than I am in regular shoes), so think about sizing down a half size. Try walking around in them in the house before removing the tags and if they still feel uncomfortable after 3-4 days, Amazon normally offers free returns. They shouldn't be painful but they will feel tight on the sides for a bit but they always do stretch enough if you get them in the right size.", "I was always curious about Toms shoes. So many people I saw had them and after a few years, I finally decided to join the bandwagon. I chose a fairly neutral blue to match much of my wardrobe. As previous reviewers have said, I agree that they are (oddly enough) very comfortable for quite a simplistic shoe. The first day I wore them, however, I did get red marks on the top of my foot (from the \u201ctriangle\u201d section), but I wore them again the next day and didn\u2019t. I figured I just needed to loosen them up a bit. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with my purchase. I wouldn\u2019t buy them full price, but I\u2019d wait for another deal.", "Do not buy Toms from Amazon!! I returned these because I am convinced they were fake!. I have owned Toms for years and this was my first time buying through Amazon- I knew right away something was wrong when I tried on this pair. I ordered my usual size 10, but they were a smaller fit than what I\u2019m used to with a size 10. I also noticed the bottom of the shoe felt softer/fuzzy/more slippery than normal, and the shoe did not conform nicely to my foot...the material felt cheap. Well, by the end of the day my feet were killing me!! Never had so much discomfort from these shoes before. One of the main reasons I buy Toms is because of the comfort, but these online ones must be dummies. Since I wasn\u2019t able to find a pair of Toms locally in my size and color of choice, I opted for a pair of Bobs because I was so frustrated at this point with the whole shoe situation- best decision I made!!

Depending on the shoe brand, I usually fall between a 7 and 7.5. Some reviews said they ran small, so I ordered these in 7.5. I probably should have gotten a 7.

I love the quality of the clothes, color selection, and how they are designed to keep you cool (or warm, depending on the line). I decided to get some more workout shirts this year and wanted to try some with a pattern rather than just the solid shirts, since I have some of those already. I didn't have any of the Twist Tech shirts and decided to give them a try.This Under Armour Twist Tech shirt is part of Under Armour's HeatGear line, which is designed to keep you cool in warm weather. This shirt is considered a LOOSE fit, which means you will most likely want to purchase a smaller size for a more comfortable fit. The shirt has a flattering V-neck cut and has a twisted, or heathered, pattern that makes it different than a solid color shirt. These shirts are made in Jordan of 100% polyester. Washing instructions say to wash with similar colors. I always put these in the washing machine on a normal cycle, hang them up to dry, and I've never had a problem with shrinking.I initially purchased one of these shirts to make sure I had the right size and loved it so much I ordered two more! For size reference, I am 5'6\", 165 pounds, with a 36D chest and some extra belly fat from my twin pregnancy and I purchased a medium. I typically wear a medium or large in shirts and, since this shirt is a loose fit, I went with the medium and it fits perfectly! These shirts are so comfortable and I wear them a lot for working out. They keep me as cool and dry as possible (of course, I still sweat). They wash up well and I am also able to wear them for everyday wear with yoga pants. My mom is in her early 60s and wears these shirts for everyday wear, along with under her scrubs for work. She loves them as much as I do and wants to get some more! The fit is nice and comes down to the top of my rear, which is just how I like. I purchased the colors Pink Shock/Metallic Silver, Mediterranean/Metallic Silver, and Absinthe Green/Metallic Silver and I'm considering purchasing a couple more.I love these shirts and feel they are great for working out or for everyday wear. Please note, this shirt is a LOOSE fit so you will want to purchase a smaller size for a more flattering fit. I'd say if you have two sizes of shirts you normally wear, purchase the smaller size for this shirt. The shirt is nice enough to wear in public and I also purchased\u00a0Under Armour Women's Armour Mid Sports Bra, Pink Shock/Rhino Gray, Large\u00a0so I could color-coordinate with my shirts.

Never snug around my waist.S is good for running but XS would have been better for weight training.(Size S width: chest 47cm, hem 51cm/ sleeve : 16cm/ length : 67cm)I learned that I should check the fit on the UA website before I buy.", "I have four of these shirts and absolutely love them! They work great for all-day wear and hold up very well during my sweaty weightlifting sessions (1.5-2 hours long). My favorite feature of these shirts would have to be their ability to make you appear less sweaty than you actually are. As someone who does power lifting, Olympic lifting, and cardio in a non-air conditioned warehouse in the South, having a t-shirt that doesn't appear soaked in sweat, and doesn't showcase big armpit sweat stains (those are the worst), ten minutes into your workout, is a miracle. It also helps that these shirts are breathable and quick to dry. After each workout, I hand-wash the shirt with a little bit of soap, gently squeeze out the water from the shirt, put it on a hanger, and hang it from my shower head to dry - that way, I don't have to buy a week's worth of shirts or do the laundry every other day.Aside from functionality, the t-shirt, for me, fits as expected and per the size chart. I tend to prefer looser-fitting shirts and size medium, for my 34C-bra size, long torso - I'm 6 ft, and swimmer's shoulders (much broader than average), fits perfectly. I don't find these shirts to be transparent at all - I can wear a bright, different-colored sports bra underneath and it doesn't show through. The colors I have are vivid and bright as well (Cobalt, Water, Dynamo Blue, and Mega Magenta).I would definitely recommend Under Armour Women's Tech Twist V-Neck to anyone, especially those who participate in a sweat-prone activity or live in a hot, humid climate!", "I'm 5'6 195 and ordered two of the XL. The fit is perfect and form fitting, not lose and not tight and that's how I wanted it. I just hope it doesn't shrink much. I'm normally an XL or XXL on Amazon. I read reviews so I knew it should fit me because it's a lose fit shirt so order a size down if you want it to be a form fit. My only complaint is that it shows my tummy bulge more then I would like. It's still flattering and cool/comfortable. I would like to get more in a larger size to have less tummy bulge and allow for shrinkage but they don't have an XXL.. It's still pretty flattering. The peach looks really pretty on me and shows my tan more.", "I recently started running (been a bit over 2 months) and I purchase more and more appropriate clothing. I came across this one and really liked the look and the price so decided to try it out. I am about 165 Ibs (75 kg) and 5'2\"(158 cm) and the medium size first me very well.The shirt is very lightweight and comfortable. It doesn\u2019t take in much sweat and dries out fairly quickly, which is very handy with my hour long exercise sessions. I owe a gray one, and it is not transparent at all.I have had this shirt for a bit over 3 weeks, absolutely love it and workout with it almost every day. So far I have no complaints at all, but will update if I get any! Absolutely recommend!", "Loose fit. I'm  usually a medium. I Need a small. Would have been fine if the description said loose fit. Product itself is 5 stars gave 4 because lack of info on description.", "Just received today.  Very happy.  Ordered XL and typically wear a L or XL.  It is roomy but in a good way.  Definitely not too big.  Very nice material and feels like it will be good for hot and humid days.", "This is my go-to T-shirt now for the gym. I love it. It's been washing up beautifully. I intentionally got it a little large so I would have full range of motion in my arms for working out. It's clearly a quality product; well constructed, excellent material.", "This is a great athletic shirt. The material is silky soft and very flattering. I wish I had listened to the other reviews about the loose fit of this shirt. I normally wear a medium and wish I had ordered a small in this particular style. I\u2019m keeping the medium because it\u2019s fine but a small would have been better. Otherwise I\u2019m verg pleased with this purchase.", "Very see-through, but ok with a tank underneath. Otherwise very pretty."]},
{"asin": "B0775PYGB3", "comments": ["I was excited to receive these shirts because I needed new plain t-shirts for summer. I read other reviews because I wasn't sure what size to order and the size chart said it was for reference only. (The size chart is way off.) I'm 5' 3\" and 190 lbs. so I'm kind of short and stout, but I have an hourglass figure. I like my tops a little loose fitting, but not really loose. I ordered XL because other reviewers around my size said it worked for them but these are pretty loose on me. If I had tried these on in a store, I probably would have bought large instead. However, I'm happy with the quality of the shirts and I'm too lazy to exchange them. They're pretty stretchy and I like that they're a bit long. I hope they shrink a little in the wash though.The only reason I took a star away is because if the fits/sizes are all the same across your brand (Amazon), provide an accurate size chart so we don't have to guess.", "My daughter and I purchased 6 of these tops for our 5 week trip to India. We wore them constantly and washed them almost daily. After hand washing and wringing, we simply hung them on a hanger and they dried quickly and wrinkle-free. Even the ribbing around the neck kept it's shape! They also breathed well and were so comfortable to wear. We were originally going to pitch them after we got back but they are still in such great shape and so comfortable I think we will be wearing them for a long time.", "Love these basic T-shirt! I will be ordering more colors. The fabric is super soft and no scratchy tag. The V at the neck is the perfect length and the shirt overall has a great length. It has just the right fit so it\u2019s not like wearing a boxy men\u2019s undershirt but not so fitted to make me uncomfortable about my muffin top (fat hanging over top of my pants). The sleeves are nicely fitted giving the shirt class.  I am 5\u20194\u201d 140lbs and purchased Medium. I might have fit into a small but have broad shoulders (and thick waistline) and prefer a little room.", "Ordered the 2-pack of white in size Small based off reviews and that is the correct size. I'm 5'6\", 34B bra size, size 4-6 in shirts (usually a small), 28\" waist (usually 28 in premium denim and size 6 in pants), and somewhat pear shaped due to having narrower shoulders and wider hips.I would give this shirt 5 stars for quality of the material at this price point. I love a modal blend and this shirt is soft and smooth, but not tissue thin. You do need to wear a nude bra with the white, but the material has a nice heft to it.The V neckline is moderate and there's no danger of cleavage or full coverage bras peeking above the neckline for me.I took off a star because this shirt is extremely long. You can see in one of the photos on the model that it's almost covering her behind. I would have to stretch the shirt to actually cover mine, but this definitely hits well below the start of the hip and I have an average length torso. I would say that this shirt fits like it was made as a tall. Ladies that are 5'4\" or shorter should be prepared for this to be tunic length.You can sort of tell from the photos that this shirt is cut to taper in slightly at the waist and then flare out across the hips. I find this flattering and I would say it fits in the bust and waist as shown in photos. If you have slim/narrow hips, then this shirt won't fit right on you.I purchased these shirts to be able to tuck into pants and they are certainly easy to do that since they are so long, although the shirt does end quite a bit beneath my pants' waistline.Note: I could have sized down to an X-Small and still have the shirt fit in the shoulders, bust, and waist, but I'm confident it would be very tight around the hips. I'm ok with it being only slightly fitted (as shown on model) and staying with the Small. But if you're hoping for a more fitted look, then this shirt isn't for you.UPDATE September 25, 2018: I wore these shirts tucked into belted jeans and pants throughout the summer and came to really love them. Fit stayed the same after numerous washes (I was on cold and dry on low heat). The material did not pill, but it's not as smooth and perfect as when I first purchased, which is to be expected. I still think the shirt should be slightly shorter, but I've come to like how I can tuck these shirts into any rise of pants. I'll be purchasing more of these 2-packs in the spring for next summer.", "I love that you cannot see through this white shirt. It\u2019s is a fairly thicker material. I am 5\u20195\u201d and weigh 185. I purchased a large hoping it would fit. And it surpassed my expectations. As you can see in the picture I probably could have sized down but because it is a somewhat stretch materia, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. It is a bit long as well so you could pair it with leggings to cover the bum and a sweater.", "Great quality, not see through.  I got the small and it fits perfectly-not too tight and not too loose.  I'm 5'8 143lbs, waist 28\".  Neckline is perfect, not too deep.  The shirt is a little too long, in my opinion, and i'll probably be take the bottom 3 inches off.  Still a perfect shirt though, I will be ordering more.", "Perfect fit!!! I\u2019m a 38DD, 5\u201910\u201d size 16 woman and the XL is true to size. Not to mention did not shrink in the drier. I\u2019m ordering more!!", "Purchased XL. I usually go with L or XL. Size 12. I'm 5'9\", 175 lbs, 38DD.  Loose fit around middle (which I wanted). A tiny bit tight around bust.  Probably won't throw in dryer.  Nice fabric weight.  Not too heavy or too thin.", "This shirt made of a good, thick, stretchy, opaque material. I purchased in white, size small. If it helps, I am 5\u20194\u201d 130#, 32dd. If you are looking for a men\u2019s style, relaxed tee, like I was, this is not it. This has more of a woman\u2019s cut to it, it is loose around my midsection and hits just below the hips, covers the midsection completely. Great shirt for the price.", "I am a 32 year old SAHM with two active little ones. I am 5\u20197\u201d tall, 135 lbs with a long torso. I purchased a size MEDIUM. These tees are perfect for my lifestyle! I love the look, feel, and durability of these tees. They can withstand a very active 12-hour day that involves heavy lifting (picking up a long, wiggle-worm baby boy multiple times) and various physical activities (chasing around an energetic toddler). I\u2019ve washed them twice and they\u2019ve held up nicely. I highly recommend these tees!!"]},

I was worried at first since his blanket doesn't have any patterns but it was close enough in color that I decided to at least try it. He took to it right away! It's so much easier to travel with this one and he can now bring it wherever he wants!

{"asin": "B07BKV4RK5", "comments": ["OK, folks, I don't often leave product reviews, but the moment these amazing sandals/flip-flops were placed upon my feet, I swear I could hear my little tootsies SING!  I have plantar fasciitis, and so I need supportive, cushy footwear. My feet are also a bit on the chubby side, so I can't wear \"normal\" sandals because they are always too tight...which means I normally just have to settle for flip flops, which are not always the perfect match for the outfit and situation that I am in.These sandals are perfect! They look dressy enough to wear with a nice summery dress out to dinner, and yet not so stuffy that I couldn't throw on a pair of short and a t-shirt and head out to the park.  They are a DREAM to walk in!!! The \"strap\" material is stretchy enough to accommodate moving around and walking, and yet supportive enough to feel like these shoes won't fall off. They do give a very slight tug back into place, if that makes sense. The cushion is perfectly squishy without being too squishy - just enough squish for my plantar fasciitis to be happy walking in these all day. No, seriously...ALL DAY.I am currently wondering what is the appropriate amount of time to wait before I tell my husband that I'm buying several more pair in other colors? Psssshaw, I'm going to just go ahead and do it!! You should, too!I normally wear a 9 1/2 to a 10, depending on the brand of shoe. I got these in a 10 and they fit me perfectly with a little room past my toes and behind my heel, but that's how I like it. Sometimes when I'm sitting or walking in just the right way, my feet always tend to shift in whatever shoes I am wearing, so I like a little room to move around.p.s. I hate it when people leave reviews saying they got their stuff for free or discounted (and, gosh, why aren't companies offering ME free stuff or discounts, eh?!)...so I'm happy to report that I am a REAL person who paid full price for these. Worth every penny!", "I've been trying to avoid dropping $30 on a pair of flip flops but after searching tirelessly for something both cheap and comfortable with no luck, I finally broke down and got some yoga slings.  Ordered the same pattern in 2 different colors and absolutely love them!

They seemed a bit big but I was leaving for the beach in just a few days, so I quickly ordered them in 8 and planned to return whichever didn't fit.  I snapped this photo of an 8 (back/left) and a 9 (front/right) in the hopes that it might help the other in-betweeners.  Maybe it's just because I have short toes but there was just too much extra space at the front for my liking.  The 8's fit great and the 9's were returned!", "I racked up a whopping 68 miles across six park days in Disney World wearing only these flip flops. My steps are often missed while I'm pushing the stroller so I'm sure there were even more miles than that. I always wear broken-in tennis shoes on big walking days and packed them with me just in case these flip flops didn't work out, but I never needed them! My feet normally get very hot and swell and I really hate wearing tennis shoes. I never wore these before our trip and was so happy there was no break in period at all. It even rained for hours on end one day and my feet were still comfortable in these. I just dried them with the hotel hairdryer that evening and wore them again the next day. The only time they were even the slightest bit uncomfortable was when my preschooler accidentally spilled orange juice on my feet and the piece between my toes got a tad sticky and rubbed. Fortunately it never caused a blister and once the fabric dried out, it was comfortable again. I would highly, highly, highly recommend these! These are going to be my forever disney, zoo day, travel, etc. shoes!! As for fit, I felt like these were a bit big. I usually wear a 7.5. I have pretty wide feet, so sometimes I need an 8 just because I need the width. I ordered an 8 in these since a half size wasn't available. The 8 felt fine enough to keep but if i order another pair, I believe I will go down to a 7.", "First off, if you're reading reviews of this product because you're considering purchasing a pair -- I can easily say just do it. These are great, comfy and adorable shoes.But I'm going to go against popular opinion here regarding going up or down for half-size people. I'm an 8.5 in everything -- boots, flats, pumps, trainers. Against my better judgement -- I followed the advice of other reviewers and went with a size down.When the shoes arrived I knew instantly that I loved them. However -- I had mixed feelings about the size. They fit -- but they *just* fit. When it comes to flip-flops I like a bit of overhand at the heel. Call it an OCD or whatever, but i like the shoe to extend ever-so-slightly from my heel.So I wrestled with what to do -- conquer my obsessive attitude and DEAL WITH IT or get a size 9.Not only did I buy a size 9 -- I bought two pairs in size 9.  AND they are PERFECT.I'm not returning the original size 8, either. I'm going to gift them to my sister who wears a 7.5 -- I just know she'll love these too.", "I have 4 pair of Sanuk Yoga Slings.

Haha.I am a size 8.5-9, and as many reviews said to do, I sized down to an 8. I think it's a perfect fit. My only concern is there's doesn't seem to be any good traction on the shoe. I stepped onto a vinyl wood floor and my foot slid around quite a bit. I'm hoping that the shoe will adapt and gain some traction over time. We shall see! In all other aspects, I love the comfort of the shoe and its aesthetics.", "Wow! Purchased these based on the reviews here and they certainly live up to the hype. I\u2019m one of those women who dreads flip flop season because any sandals that I have worn in the past become uncomfortable after an hour of wearing them - whether it\u2019s the flimsy padding or the plastic part that goes between your toes. The soles on these are padded - I just got these but after trying them on, I actually forgot to take them off and wore them all day inside while I was cleaning. Secondly, the part that goes between the toes (is there an actual name for that?!) is cloth material and is reinforced with additional cloth material (its soft and almost feels like silk) that makes these feel indestructible.

I bought for a cruise because nothing is worse than sore feet or a sandal that rubs into a blister.

{"asin": "B071P3PQZ8", "comments": ["Note about pictures:  these are how they look after several months of wear.  I've included the Kadee next to the citilane so you can see the difference between unisex and standard sizing.I bought a pair of these in size 7 in black at the same as the size 7w citilane unisex crocs in red.  Very disparate ideas of what a size 7 is between both sandals.The citilane were very wide and chucky, and the straps ended up giving me a flew blisters.  These are vary narrow and a little undersized but are otherwise more comfortable to me and zero blisters.  These also feel a little less supportive and cushioned than the citilane, but I still find them more comfortable.I've worn them for months, and on several multi mile walks, and they've been nothing but comfortable.I figured I'd reorder in size 8 for my next pair (the lemon ones) because my heel sat a bit too close to the back on the 7.  Well, heel sits just as close on the 8 so the only difference is more length where the toes are and more width.I'm generally a size 7 to 7 and a half.

I took them on a beach trip the first week I had them and they did great walking in the sand and were easy to clean. The issue came when I rinsed them off and left them on the deck to dry...they shrunk. When I say say shrunk, I mean they went from a perfect size 9 to a size 6!! They were in the sun for less than 2 hours when I tried to put them on and realized that my heel was hanging off the back. I compared them with another pair I bought in a different color and could not believe how small they had become! I would give them 5 stars if it were not for the incredible shrinkage.", "I really wanted a pair of summer sandals that I could wear all day without dying of foot and leg pain at the end of the day and I know from experience the foot bed of the croc shoe is very comfy.  I also didn't want to break the bank. Problem is, I normally wear a size 8 but every size 8 croc's I've ever tried are too long for my feet, leaving more than a full inch of space from end of toe to tip of shoe. This causes me to trip over my own toes or 'drag' the toe every so often, so I no longer buy size 8 croc's. I also need a wide shoe and must beware of  multiple straps because they can pinch and bind in all the wrong places.  I decided on the tried and true flip flop, as they can usually accommodate wide feet due to the basic \"openness\" of the shoe. I took a chance and ordered down to a size 7 and glad I did because size 8 would have been way to long. I do wish the flops offered a little more arch support as I have high arches, but all in all, they are working out well. The back of my heel sits right at the heel cup and there is still room at the toe as you can see in the pics. I love the squishy bouncy feel of the shoe when walking or standing. I broke one of my toes before these arrived and will be wearing them daily until my toe heals.  FYI, I deducted one star for lack of half sizes and one star for mediocre arch support.", "I decided to go one size up and they fit perfect! I normally order size 8 in sandals that have no half sizes but after reading reviews, I decided to go with a 9. I wear 8.5 in closed toe shoes and 8 in sandals. So go with a 9 if you normally wear an 8 or an 8.5. These shoes are a whole size off. I owned and loved my Kadee originals but my puppy chewed them up last week and I thought I could get another pair and they were no longer available. The Kadee 2's are just as comfortable on day one. The Kadee originals, I had to wear for a couple weeks and got a blister and then they fit well. These are good right out of the box. They are not as arch supportive as the originals but they will do. These feel a bit thinner.  Although, I am still looking for another pair to wear around the house on tile floors. These do have a bit of arch support but for flat floors, I feel I need a bit more. The price on these is a winner. I would buy them again, good shopping shoe but not all day support. If you have lower back problems like I do from gluten allergies and looking for all day wear on cement floors get another style. Good garden shoe, easy rinse and go.", "My daughter needed shower shoes for college dorm use,  and these are  perfect for that: all rubber so they dry quickly, grippy bottom and inside, wide enough. But as for wearing them as regular flip-flops: probably not. They are very thin and flexible---if you walk too fast, the front edge can catch on the ground and bend completely under your foot, tripping you---and the raised-dot pattern on the soles is uncomfortable to walk or stand in for long periods of time.She normally wears a size 10, but ordered 11 in these so they'd be loose enough for easy showering.

I ordered these Crocs flip flops hoping they would be a better option, and they certainly are! The are very lightweight, surprisingly supportive for a flip flop, and a little bit cushy. As long as I am not walking or on my feet all day, they are comfortable for hours! My only minor disappointment was the color.

The thong part popped on the right one. So I ordered the same pair, same size. Hit \"order again\". What I received was shorter, tighter, and feels hard. I put the old one next to the new one. The new one is not the same. The design inside of the flip flop is different. There is no crocodile in the heel bed. No wiggle room. I have wide feet and these are not comfortable. I'll try gorilla glue on the old ones. Btw, I ordered the size 11 for \"end of work day comfort\", and literally hit \"order again\". So disappointing...smh.", "I ordered theses in size 8W/6M for myself who is somewhere between 7.5 and 8 in laides shoes.  These shoes are way too small.  Since they fit my moer who wear a size 6.5.

Ever in search of a decent bra that fits properly, and after reading reviews that said the cups ran large and the band ran small, I decided to go out on a limb and order one. To be sure, I took my measurements, and by normal sizing, I need a band of 40 in an A -almost B- cup. And that has pretty much been my size for over 10 years. I can and do wear a 40B in some bras (namely underwire, stretchy fabric ones without the padding), but a formed B cup is a little too big- it gaps. So, with the band size reported to run small, I upped from my usual 40 and ordered a 42. I was shocked.. the band was still way too small. I added a bra extender just so I could try it on, and the cups were a perfect fit, but even with a 2\" extender it was still way too tight. I removed the extender, laid the bra out flat to measure it and it was barely 32\" across! I returned it, and while I want to reorder in a 44 or a 46, they're more expensive, go figure! Plus, I'm worried that the straps will be too far apart and wind up slipping off my shoulders. While the bra appeared well made, I had to take off 1 star for the outrageous discrepancy in the band size. I feel bad for people who order this bra, but do not have the option of free return shipping with Amazon Prime Membership. If you find yourself in that boat I strongly encourage you to contact the seller to resolve the issue. It's not fair to sell an item that does not meet a universal sizing standard. I did go ahead and order their \"Underwire Padded T-shirt Bra' in a 44A. I'll review it on that page when it arrives in a couple of days.", "I always knew I was an \"A\" cup even though I needed a large band size. Because \"A\" cups are not sold in stores in larger sizes, I bought 38B padded bras (to hide all the empty space) &amp; used bra extenders. The bra extenders meant the straps constantly slipped down because the straps  were now too near my shoulders.In January, I had had enough. I decided go to make a trip to a bra specialty store, \"Wizard of Bras,\" bite the bullet &amp; pay for a good bra. They measured me above my breasts &amp; under my arms (surprise) to determine my band size correctly, 42. But the sales person kept bringing me 40Bs. The cup still puckered. Apparently, even they didn't have my size in an \"A\" cup.Back to Amazon... I found this returnable style in a Nude 42A for $38. It fits perfectly. Nothing fancy, but there are no more puckered cups. The straps stay put since I no longer need bra extenders. It is comfortable &amp; naturally shaped. It is lined enough to prevent show thru. The only negative is that the straps sometimes show if I wear a wider neckline top. (But in nude, it's not that bad.) I was so happy, I purchased 3 more today after wearing it for a month. To my surprise it was now only $27. (What's up with those on again/off again price changes? At least this time it was in my favor.)PSI tried 2 other 42A bras from Amazon which I didn't like as well... Amoena Women's Rita Wire-Free with Coolmaxa Pockets Bra, Nude, 42A, &amp; The Perfect \"A\" Bra- Specifically Designed for A cups sizes 38 to 58, Taupe, 42A. The Amoena bra was not comfortable at all. The Perfect \"A\" bra was OK, but more heavily padded &amp; stiff. It was not nearly as comfortable. The free return policy on these styles permitted me to get more of the bra that actually fit.", "1. The reinforcement support  \"beams\" on the sides are like daggers just under my armpit.2. The cups make my breasts look like the are looking ways at once. left pointing left and right pointing right. The peaks couldn't even come straight out in front of my body. Nope. They had to be all whawnky.Most definitely will not buy again.", "I'm a 42 or 44A and no one makes bras that fit that size. I was excited to see this product. I wasn't disappointed when I got it. It fits so nice. Perfect for a flat chested larger woman.", "I feel like Goldilocks with this bra style.  My \"normal\" size is 46C.  I previously ordered 48B due to other reviews indicating the band size ran small and the cups ran big.  The 48B's were acceptable--the band size was good but the cups were STILL too big.  With the padded cup style, this can create some unnatural lumps under form fitting tops when you are sitting down.  I ordered a 48A this time and it's too small.If you are a borderline C/D cup, the B cup should be fine, but also be sure to order up 1 band size.  I would recommend not even trying this style unless you can get free returns.", "Maybe it's my own fault, that is certainly possible, but this is the both the smallest and biggest bra of this size I've ever purchased. I've always had a hard time finding bras. As a larger woman with a small chest, there are virtually no stores around me that sell bras that fit me. I always have to come up with some work around to make one fit that is ultimately uncomfortable at best and makes my breasts look weird at worst. When I saw that they offered large A size bras, I was both excited and nervous, excited because I've never seen a bra that may potentially fit without having to use some sort of insert into the cup or a strap extender, but scared because I don't know my exact size and buying a bra without seeing it first is inherently scary. In the end I decided to get a couple strap sizes larger than the bra I currently wear (a 42) and ended up selecting a 46 A. When I tried it on today, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The cup size was still far too big -- neither of my breasts fit, there was lots of room in both cups and that simply shouldn't be the case considering one of my breasts is actually a size B while the other is a size A. It's also very tight around my chest at the same time, despite the fact that all my other bras are 42s and 44s. I'm giving this a 2 rather than a 1 because I think with a small extender and an insert into the cup, this will still be a fine bra it's just incredibly disheartening that the bra I purchased to actually, for once in my life fit me, still doesn't make the cut. You get what you pay for, I guess.", "Only brand bra that actually fits me my weird size. I have several of these, from 38B and C to 46A and B. Depending on my weight any given day, I might wear a smaller or larger band. The cup size in each band size is proportional to my fit, very natural. The straps are wide enough to be comfortable and they stay in place. There is no gapping. Looks good under clothes, even under tighter garments or stretchy fabrics that lie close to the skin. I like the depth of the plunge-not too deep but also not cut too high in front (a common, annoying, problem for me with plus size bras!) I like the colors but I wish it came in a pink-er beige and brown. Also, if this brand and the molded cup style came in a strapless version (with removable clear straps) I would definitely buy it in every color!", "I wanted to like this bra. I really did. It was comfortable and wide enough to fit around my huge torso. Then I turned around and BAM... pepperoni nipples. It would be one thing of they were my own nips, which are very small. But this bra had giant nipples built into it. Im not sure if it was supposed to look like that or just the fabric was wonky, but it looked like I had porn star breasts, in a bad way. I bought this bra for nipple coverage, not embellishment. So disappointed.", "I still haven't found the perfect bra, but this brand/style was considered \"wearable\" for me. The support without the underwire is not fantastic for a larger cup size, but I knew that going into it. I'd prefer comfort and flexibility over stiff and super-perky. The only thing that was odd to me was the cup shape, which gave the bra the appearance of slight darts at the nipple  - I look a lot pointier in this bra than I do in others."]},

Even with horrible bunions the shoes will work. Just give yourself a couple days and you will love the fit.  I can wear Toms shoes and foot problems go unnoticed. If you are a person that can\u2019t wear just anything and waisted money for comfort and style, you just might have found a solution.  Try Toms", "I seriously love TOMS. I got this exact pair (color and size) several years ago from the TOMS website and wore them out so much, I thought it was finally time for a new pair (see picture). Unfortunately, at this point in my life, $50 plus shipping for a pair of shoes is just not in the budget, no matter how much I love them and how much use I will get out of them. I really do like the TOMS company, and would love to support them, but cannot afford it. Here I go to Amazon to find one for PRIME and only $35!! Seriously the most comfortable pair of shoes I own; I wear them all summer long.  As you can see from the photo, I get A LOT of use out of them, and they've held up wonderfully through the abuse I've put them through (several vacations, water rides, college campus walking, a puppy chewing them, working outside in the garden, and many many many steps). Will definitely recommend TOMS to anyone!!", "I have had these shoes for less than a month and they are absolutely destroyed!  I guess the chambray fabric just isn't sturdy enough!  The shoes are super comfortable but I'm going to go back to canvas TOMS from now on.  Incredibly disappointing!", "TOMS are always difficult for certain people to wear. I don't have narrow feet but I have a high discomfort tolerance when it comes to my feet in new shoes. I know that with TOMS, it normally takes them a week before my feet feel comfortable in them. Once they stretch out a bit, I can honestly wear these day and night. They're not meant for hiking, rainy weather, beaches, etc. so if you use them all the time, they will most certainly wear out quickly. I use them for running errands, shopping, walking around town, etc. and they have lasted me at least a year before needing replacement (and that was with me getting caught in the rain with them several times). I'm always a size 6 in TOMS (about half a size smaller than I am in regular shoes), so think about sizing down a half size. Try walking around in them in the house before removing the tags and if they still feel uncomfortable after 3-4 days, Amazon normally offers free returns. They shouldn't be painful but they will feel tight on the sides for a bit but they always do stretch enough if you get them in the right size.", "I was always curious about Toms shoes. So many people I saw had them and after a few years, I finally decided to join the bandwagon. I chose a fairly neutral blue to match much of my wardrobe. As previous reviewers have said, I agree that they are (oddly enough) very comfortable for quite a simplistic shoe. The first day I wore them, however, I did get red marks on the top of my foot (from the \u201ctriangle\u201d section), but I wore them again the next day and didn\u2019t. I figured I just needed to loosen them up a bit. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with my purchase. I wouldn\u2019t buy them full price, but I\u2019d wait for another deal.", "Do not buy Toms from Amazon!! I returned these because I am convinced they were fake!. I have owned Toms for years and this was my first time buying through Amazon- I knew right away something was wrong when I tried on this pair. I ordered my usual size 10, but they were a smaller fit than what I\u2019m used to with a size 10. I also noticed the bottom of the shoe felt softer/fuzzy/more slippery than normal, and the shoe did not conform nicely to my foot...the material felt cheap. Well, by the end of the day my feet were killing me!! Never had so much discomfort from these shoes before. One of the main reasons I buy Toms is because of the comfort, but these online ones must be dummies. Since I wasn\u2019t able to find a pair of Toms locally in my size and color of choice, I opted for a pair of Bobs because I was so frustrated at this point with the whole shoe situation- best decision I made!! Bob\u2019s all the way for this girl now! If you\u2019re set on buying Toms,  I would really avoid Amazon and just stick with local stores or buy it through the Tom\u2019s website.", "I have never tried TOMS brand shoes before, but I'm always on the lookout for comfy, stylish walking shoes. While I like ballet flats, sizing and fit is always tricky with my narrow, in-between sizes feet.I really liked the feel of these shoes, and they seem like they would be really comfortable, however they're too big. Depending on the shoe brand, I usually fall between a 7 and 7.5. Some reviews said they ran small, so I ordered these in 7.5. I probably should have gotten a 7. Perhaps the sizing varies across the different models and materials. I like these enough that I will try to exchange for the right size.I ordered the Rose Gold Crochet Glitter pair, but I would call it more of a champagne than rose gold. It's pretty close to the product photo.", "My go-to shoes, and cheaper on Amazon than other sites!!  I'm a teacher, so I wanted shoes that were comfortable but cute. The black ones are perfect, and I can wear them with pretty much anything.  They do smell though.  I wear them with no-show socks, but if I wear them without socks, they definitely smell more than other pairs of shoes.  Not a huge deal, but something to be aware of.", "DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES! These are definitely not real TOMS. I have had several pairs of Toms in the past and they always fit wonderfully and feel really well made. These shoes, on the other hand, feel very cheap and smell absolutely horrible when you take them out of the box.

It fits perfectly with my feet at size 8.5\". I feel like buying another pair and rock more TOMS shoes during the spring &amp; summer seasons. My only issue is that when it gets wet, you would have to wait a while for it to dry up. I don't recommend this to be a outdoor trail or hiking shoe but, I mainly used it for that during my photography trips.Pro's:- Comfortable and breathable- Simple Stylish trend- Cheaply PricedCons:- Takes a while to dry up- You can slip around if you lose traction- It can slip off your feet if you run too fast but, thats a given if you aren't wearing socks- Not intended for outdoor trail walks or hikes"]},

I don't mind form fitting clothing as I am slim but the medium is really bordering on too small and I usually wash everything hot or permanent press but this is going to have to go cold and hang dry which isn't ideal for a workout shirt.

I wish you could return things if you only wash it 1 time on delicate cycle. One of the straps broke in the middle of the strap which means poor quality material.

I would recommend this to a friend.", "So I have this exact same shirt in another color, and one size larger (3x), and I absolutely love it.  The original one I ordered is SO big, but super comfy and it's my go to for relaxing around the house, so I decided to get another one a size smaller (2x) so I could wear it running errands and what not and look a little more put together.  Well, this one is super small.  I held them up next to each other, and this one, while only ONE size smaller, looks to be at least 2-3 (like a M at best when placed on top of the 3x) when compared to the other one, and I compared them upon opening the package, so the old one of mine had been washed and dried tons of times, and the new one was right out of the package, no washing or drying yet.  So now I'm not sure if my first one was mislabeled and was really much larger than I had originally ordered, or if this one was mislabeled and is really smaller than I ordered.  If the sizing was consistent I'd give 5 stars because the shirts themselves are good quality, but the sizing is in consistent making it hard to order.  I'm hesitant to reorder in a 3x because I don't want it to be huge like the original one I bought.", "So normally I wear a medium, but some reviewers said to go on size up. Luckily I did that and the top fits Amazing. Definitely one size up from what you normally wear.

Young people, if you don't get my review...just wait until you're faced with the same problems (sorry).

I ordered the black body with gray arms after reading how sheer the lighter colors are.  The V in the neck is rather large.  I have not washed this yet.", "I followed the instructions on the size chart but it didn't look like an XL would fit me. It said an XL was for a size 8 with a bust size of 36 inches. This usually means across your bust and around, not below it like a bra size. I'm 42 around the bust as I wear a DD. So I thought the XXL would work. When it got here It was way too big and not in a \"its supposed to be loose\" kind of way, I was swimming in it. Needless to say, I returned it. There was no issue with the product its self, it was soft material and seemed well made. The size chart was just way off.", "I\u2019ve been looking for tips that are comfortable with easy wear.  This top is just that.  The material is thin/lightweight and hopefully it will keep its shape after washing.  I did buy an xxl after reading the reviews and going over the size chart.  I should have purchased the xl.  That\u2019s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The chart it a little off.  It is too big, but that\u2019s okay since it\u2019s just for lounging.  I\u2019ll probably buy another and will size down.", "If you have a frame like the model shown, and if it was a tapered fit, then it would look good. It's a boxy fit and if you are bigger proportioned woman like me, then it comes off like a big black square making you look larger. I sent it back. I would have loved it to look as cute as it does in the ad."]},
{"asin": "B008P4ACBA", "comments": ["First of all, these shirts are not made in the USA, at least not the ones I got. I realize the description says \"made in the USA or imported\" but if you look at the questions section everyone is saying they're made in the US. I'm guessing they used to be, but they aren't anymore. Gildan now owns AA and it even says Gildan on the label. My shirts were made in Honduras.But really the main issue I have is the size. I bought these because I'm tall and thin and I love how AA shirts fit. These shirts are WAY BIGGER than the old ones. I attached a picture showing my old AA size large made in the US next to this new one, also size large, made in Honduras so you can see just how much bigger this shirt is. It's huge.I'm very disappointed. Will update this review if the shirts shrink in the wash, but I'm doubtful they'll shrink that much. Too bad to see American Apparel quality go down the drain with the new owners.", "I'm convinced these are counterfeit. They don't feel like the shirts I've worn every day for years, they feel totally different. The fabric is \"tight\" and was too small on arrival, only to shrink even more with a wash and hang dry. When I purchased these, they were listed as approximately 50% less than the usual retail price of $18 each.I don't normally do many reviews but this was a bummer. If you're focused on saving money, order at least a size up. If you love the classic AA tee, these are not right. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because of the off chance that this is where the old \"not so perfect\" tees went to die, and they just haven't clarified that in the listing for half price black t-shirts. Basically, they're shirts that you can put on your body, but they're not what I expected.", "I've ordered maybe a dozen over the past couple of years and up until now I was receiving surplus stock of OG American Apparel made in Los Angeles shirts.This time I received the new Gildan Made in Honduras shirts and, yeah, it sucks.

Sleeve circumference was never super wide like a cheap tee but hovered just around or slightly snug on arm.  What was received was something you'd buy at Walmart under $10.  As usual, you get what you pay for.", "I purchased this shirt for my husband, along with a variety of others, as he needed some 100% cotton t-shirts for work. After doing a bunch of research, I decided to purchase this particular shirt because I love that it's made in the USA and that's hard to find these days. I had a feeling this t-shirt was going to run small, not just because it's 100% cotton, but also because it seems that most manufacturers are trending towards a more \"unisex\" fit. The hubby normally wears an XL, so I went with an XXL just in case - too big is always better than too small. Fresh out of the package, this shirt was huge but after the first was it shrunk down to what I would consider to be a slightly roomy XL size. The shirt shrunk evenly all the way around and maintained it's shape nicely after the first wash. Overall this shirt is great quality, but a little bit on the small side - mainly through the shoulders.", "Thought from the reviews they might be like the t-shirt's of the good old days but, alas, they are too thin.  I ordered them from 'UnderMoments' After a couple of washes you will be seeing through them.  Also, the sizing was a little small and, being 100% cotton, they will be way small after washing.  If you order them for your regular size and then dry them in the dryer they will be at least one size too small, maybe two.", "(This review is in reference to the Light Blue size Large AA2001.  I'm 6'2\"/185lbs.)  First of all, the color is more green than is shown in the photo.  If you're looking for baby blue/pale blue, I don't think this is it.  It's really more of a light teal.  I've purchased other AA2001 shirts that were (way) more fitted and which had less tendency to \"wing\" in the sleeves.  I'm guessing these are the \"new\" American Apparel shirts as manufactured by Gildan?", "Disappointed in the quality of this shirt. After less than a month the hem on one sleeve split (see picture). Otherwise it is comfortable, soft cotton in the size I ordered. I'm a little surprised as another AmerApparel t-shirt I own has lasted for almost four years &amp; stood up to merciless wear &amp; tear &amp; washings. Makes you wonder about quality control.", "Nice color shirt, fits a little small. This actually worked out for me because I meant to buy a medium for my dad (who wears small to medium) and bought a large instead... which still fit fine. So expect it to run small. Material feels nice though and he said it was comfortable.", "Got mine from \"Nayked Apparel\" so can approve they are legit to begin with. Good. After washing? not so good. I used machine 30c (which is also referred as \"cold\", if you go with totally cold, the cleaning suffers). Most shirts shrunk a bit, but it wasn't consistent. One of them I can't wear anymore. One of them (on arrival) had a loose seam. The shop didn't give a crap about me so fixed it myself. Overall this is not the quality that Threadless once used when they utilized this AA tee. After a long time search, I don't think you can find a quality tee as good as once possible. I had better experience with FOTL heavy-cotton shirts, but they are proving a little hard to get.

The neck is perfect, with just the right mock to have embroidery put on, which I have done at a local embroidery shop.  The material is soft. After one washing and drying, there was little shrinkage.  You can't beat these for the price.  Target and Kohl's are twice the price at regular.

I\u2019m assuming because of this fabric blend, the shirt fits a lot tighter than I would\u2019ve liked. If this was a 100% cotton shirt, maybe I could work with it.  That being said, it did look like the picture.  This could be a good work out shirt but would not recommend for every day wear.", "Gave as a gift during the holidays and she's worn it many times since. So a success in that regard! Only disappointment is that the \"girl power\" lettering is not as bright as the picture shows. It is a much darker red, thus harder to see.", "this shirt fit terribly because it was way to long and the sleeves were too short. also the printing looks different because it looks smaller and this is not the fabric i wanted it looks like I'm wearing a piece of paper!", "I ordered black. If fits like a ladies fitted T-shirt, I got an extra large because other reviews stated it ran small.  It's form fitting but not tight, I usually wear a large or extra large.  I like the material. The tag says 95% cotton and 5% spandex. It's smooth and soft almost like sweat wicking type of material.  The print is smaller than the image but that's not a big deal to me.  Looking for to wearing it.", "It says that each shirt is a little different cause someone made it by hand... So I wasn't surprised when the print was smaller than the picture. Still awesome. The fabric isn't a traditional tee cotton, it feels more like rayon... Which isn't a bad thing in my opinion, just FYI."]}
