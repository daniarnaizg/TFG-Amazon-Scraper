            "I recently replaced my 3 Jerzee sleaveless with 3 Champions.PROS:The Champions look a little better and hang a little better.Fabric is soft.Logo on front is nice, muted black.CONS:Fabric is a little thinner than I would have liked.Logo on back is brightly colored and unnecessary branding.  I will use a marker to blacken it.SUMMARY:Decent sleaveless, with normal sized arm holes.  Fabric is 100% cotton and thin, so very good for extreme heat and sunblock on the shoulders.",
            "I wish I did not buy this.  it shrank a lot in the wash and I washed it with cold water.  It is now sitting in my drawer waiting for me to lose 20 lbs.",
            "My husband is a Large in any other shirt.  I had previously purchased a large and it is too small after washing. He likes the cut of this shirt and likes that it is cotton so I purchased an XL and after washing it fits like the Large we were originally hoping for.  Almost borderline too short though. He is 6\u20192\u201d",
            "I have a really solid, well-fitting basic sleeveless tee from Champion that's served me very well; it's super comfortable and my favorite shirt to work out in. I wanted to pick up another one so I bought this item.What I didn't realize is that they had updated their basic tee, and the old style I liked was #T2231. That one is made from a really sturdy cotton, with reinforced neck and arm cutouts.This one, style #T0222, is a downgrade. The fabric is much flimsier and the fit isn't as nice. The arms flare out awkwardly and don't have the same fitted construction, with much larger/droopier cutouts.I returned mine and will try to snag the other style.",
            "T-shirt bought specifically for training, the size is more for comfort. embroidered badge the champ is glued behind, fabric is thin and soft, perfectly felt on the body, excellent for warm weather.",
            "Amazing purchase. Fits comfortably and shows off arms (even my limited 2-month progress arms!)Not tight in the chest area, but not extra loose ether. It definitely will show chest gains, but remain comfortable to stretch and be active in. Looks amazing! I\u2019ve received many compliments with it on.Going to buy a red one.",
            "Wow, this shirt is amazing!  Trim athletic fit and seems to be very high quality material.  Perfect for the gym and better than most shirts two or three times more expensive.  I'm going to have to buy one in every color.",
            "I really like these \"authentic\" Champion shirts.They're like a slim fit,---not big and baggy around the waist like most shirts nowadays.I'm buying three more before they \"go out of style\" and become \"relaxed fit\"!",
            "In my opinion this shirt fit a little snug for me. I was also disappointed with the rather thin material and lack of opacity in the white T-shirt. I like a white T-shirt where my skin does not show through. This could be a great shirt though for someone really looking for an athletic cut to show off and athletic body.",
            "I was looking for a great way to show off the arms and not have so much of a farmers tan while working out. The wife beater shirt was a little too much but this one is the mullet of shirts. The collar that screams business, with the lack of sleeves  that screams ready to party! The fish was excellent, and as expected. I am fairly tall so I always worry that the shirts will ride up when I lift my arms up. I can say that I lift my arms up and no leg m The fit was excellent, and as expected. I am fairly tall so I always worry that the shirts will write up when I lift my arms up. I can say that I lift my arms up and no ligma showing. The ladies can hardly keep their hands off me now. Even though I had initially a problem with shipping, it was handled very quickly and the item was delivered fast."

            "I notice that many people are complaining about the number of pages the ink prints.  I too had this problem at first.  The solution was simple.  I put the settings on draft which prints the same quality with less ink.  Standard print eats a lot of ink and if you put it on best it definitely consumes ink really quick.  I keep my printer set on draft and change it to standard only when doing special printing such as t-shirts, invitations or greeting cards.  When the light comes on that means that you have at least 50 pages (sometimes more) that you can print before you run out of ink.  I was able to put the cartridges I removed (because of the low ink light) back into the printer and got 50 or more pages out of them.  Just glad I decided to try it before I threw the cartridges away.  I hope this helps.",
            "Yes, this was easy to install.  No, it wasn't worth the purchase price.  I printed out about 15 pages and all of a sudden my low ink light was back on.  Yes, the printer was inexpensive, but I have since tossed it because the cost of the ink was going to bankrupt me.  I am very disappointed because I liked the printer.  This is no deal.  Maybe if you print something every week or two, but not good for daily use.",
            "Didn't seem to last as long as I expected.  But that may be misleading, since it starts telling you your ink levels are low when the cartridge is maybe one-half consumed. The Pop-up warning screen shows the ink level to be like maybe 5%, when you still have lots of ink left.  So, don't replace the cartridge until it actually stops printing.  For me, that was at least one hundred copies later.",
            "This is the first time I ordered just the black ink (I usually get the combo) but there is no reason it should be such a poor product...they are the same thing. This printed 10 pages vs 25 with the one I got in the combo pack. I couldn't finish my project even. NEVER again!",
            "Would of gave it five stars but could only afford 4 after buying ink lol",
            "I am very dissapointed. I put this in today and after making four copies my printer says I need new ink.",
            "As with all Canon ink cartridges, runs out much too quickly. This was never a problem some years back but most definitely is now. I used to print regularly and only had to replace ink every few months but now it seems even with hardly printing anything at all, the ink runs out. It is getting to where buying a new printer is cheaper than buying ink!",
            "Lasted for about 15 sheets. Very much a scam. I thought i was imagining things, or perhaps doing something wrong with the printer settings but, after reading others\u2019 reviews, I\u2019ve concluded it\u2019s a scam. I saved 5 cartridges I have bought and used in about one year, and I hardly ever print. Waste of money, shipping and packaging. Someone should complain that this is FRAUDULENT.",
            "works well and easy to install, swapping cartridges takes 15 seconds. For some reason, the canon printers burn lots of black ink. It could be the consumption rate or the cartridge itself that requires this much ink. I don't print much so it isn't a issue.PS: Based on the supreme court decision in Lexmark v. Impression, it is fully legal and permissible for a third party to fill your ink cartridges. Not sure if there is one yet for this cartridge, but maybe worth a search? Hope that saves you some money!",
            "It just doesn't seem fair that these ink cartridges are so darn expensive. The quality of re-manufactured or other brand cartridges is just the same, but the problem is that Canon printers detect them and flash up a warning and won't work with anything of a reasonable cost. So we are stuck with buying Canon's new ones.Canon compensates by selling the printer for $34! The Canon printer is wonderful and definitely my favorite among all the many other brands I've owned. But it doesn't seem fair that the ink is so very expensive -- not much of a discount for buying in bulk, either.I'd be happier if they would do good discounts if you are buying 3 or more. Give the consumer a break."

            "The review you are looking for:6.1 185 lbs extra large ordered.  Fits exactly the same as all major crappy cotton shirts in the USA.  Compare size to:  Basic Editons, Haynes, Carhartt (not Carhartt quality), Fruit of the Loom, Polo; all of which I have in my closet.  Do you have any type of cotton t-shirt in any of these brands?  If so, then whatever the size they are is the length and width of these shirts.  The arm holes are the size of a standard shirt with sleeves but only these are sleeveless and are exactly proportionate to the picture.I half expected to get a shirt waaaaaaaay to small or waaaaaaay to big and for the arm holes to be too big or clownish based on some of the reviews, but that just isn't what I got.  I got a shirt sized exactly as every run of the mill cotton shirt in my closet but only this one doesn't have sleeves.100 percent double stitched.  It's ok, just buy it in your size like you were at K-mart and if it doesn't fit then you can return or exchange it for free.  It only took four days to get it.",
            "",
            "6'0\" about 175 with medium build is my figure.I like how the tank top fits. Its not like a wife beater in tightness or a thin strapped tank top. It covers to the edge of my shoulder. Has a decently soft texture and has a small tag near the love handle.Other than that, it is a good shirt that is decently priced. I will be buying more eventually. Hope it lasts a long time too.",
            "I bought this shirt and the CHAMPION equivalent in order to the compare the two.The Champion is the better shirt overall. The arm holes on the Russell are weakly reinforced and do not hold their shape. The fabric has a tendency to \"roll.\" The arm openings are also too large. By comparison, the Champion arm openings are strongly reinforced and the openings are sized correctly...like a t-shirt with the sleeves removed. The material on the Russel is also thinner giving it a flimsy feel. The one area in which the Russel is better is the fit to size. The Champion seems to run a little small. So I'd go with the Champion and maybe size up one size.",
            "I'd like this product more if the armholes weren't large enough to fit a small child through them. Aside from that it's a well made 100% cotton shirt. I love that there isn't an annoying neck tag. The color holds really well. Product quality is great, even after several months, it's not showing signs of wear.I am a large busted and broad shouldered woman and I don't particularly like women's tank tops since they never fit right as I like my clothes to be loose fitting. I don't like exposing my bra to the world which is why I take issue with the size of the arm holes. The picture and product don't match up in that respect.",
            "These shirts do not wick at all. I mis-read another review and thought it said wicking. I bought these to wear in martial arts. I use them to sleep in now instead.Stitching started to come out around the arm holes, and the neck after the second was on all there.  I've woken up a few times with the thread used for stitches wrapped around my kneck. Not enough to be dangerous, just annoying and pulls the shirt funny (which wakes me up).",
            "I ordered two Russell Men's Essential Muscle t-shirts - a blue one and a black one.  Supposed to be the same exact style and model with the only difference was the color.  The Blue one was exactly as described - a Russell sleeveless t-shirt.  the Black one was something else - it was not a Russell and in fact had no identifying name tag.  Also the sleeve holes were not hemmed and in fact looked as though they had been cut out by someone wild with scissors.  I am sure Russell would be embarrassed to have this product associated with their brand.  I gave a 3 because I could not give a 2 1/2 star rating - as only one was right.  I threw the other one away.",
            "I bought this shirt in November of 2018 and wear it all the time.  I love the heck out of it.  One of my fav tank tops.  I liked it so much that I bought another identical one in April of 2019 and then the issue arose.  The first one fit just perfectly, but the second one doesn't \"sit\" right.  It tends to bunch up around the neck and shoulders instead of laying flat like the first one.  I thought it might need to be \"broken in\" but I've had it for 2 months now and it just fits horribly every time I try to wear it.  Super disappointed in the 2nd one but I think I waited too long to try and return it.  I think I'm going to order one more to see if I just got lucky with the first one or If I just got unlucky with the 2nd one.  Here's hoping......",
            "I love this shirt. It doesn't shrink much, so even after being washed and dried it fits very well. It's baggy, which I prefer, and being that we're consistently hitting around 100 degrees (F) in Houston on a daily basis... it's comfortable all around.I bought a few of these a while back, and so I've bought another to have a new and extra one in rotation. I'd recommend these to anyone looking for this style, whatever your reasons may be.",
            "I ordered two of these for my college-age son and my high school-age son for them to wear during band camp this summer. They're both slender guys with broad shoulders so I ordered a large. The length of the shirt and the shoulder width fit them great but the arm holes are HUGE! For what they intend to wear them for, they are fine with the large arm hole size but keep in mind, it may not be to the liking of a typical wearer."

            "This is an alright shirt, as the fit is good (good length, nice fit in the body, longer tail). However the quality of the fabric seems to be lacking. I've worn the shirt just 3 times and it already has a couple very small pulls in the fabric. I've never had an Under Armour shirt pull this easily. It makes me wonder if this is an authentic shirt or just a fake.",
            "This was recommended in one of the online running blogs specifically as a higher quality shirt that doesn't chafe.My usual point of comparison for  running shirts is the North Face \"Better Than Naked\" line. I understand that those are priced much higher, but  I was hoping that at the very least, the Under Armour was going to be at least a little close to the TNF than something like a Target brand.Sad to say, the Under Armour is pretty much the same quality as the $10 offerings from Target. The material is light and decently moisture wicking, but has pretty rough texture and tends to really cling to the body.  Towards the end of a medium, 6 mile run in this shirt, I started feeling a pretty significant chafing discomfort. So one of the main reasons for which I got this shirt didn't work out, therefore I can't recommend it.",

            "I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.",
            "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.",
            "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(",
            "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.",

This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.",

            "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.",
            "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"

            "I read some reviews of this shirt about the sizing which stated buy a size smaller that you would normally buy, so I bought a medium as I would normally buy a large.  The medium was too small.  I returned and bought a large which is perfect.  So for me, I buy this shirt in a large as I would for any other shirt I would buy.  The shirt is wrinkled when arriving.  I used a steamer, and it removed the wrinkles nicely and quickly.  Be careful using a steamer.  It is nylon/polyester, so I just hit it quickly and don't leave it too long in one place.  The steamer is always moving over the fabric.  Good shirt. I like it , and will probably build a collection of these in different colors.  Excellent summer shirt, and will be cooler than a T-shirt in my estimation.  Never heard of a fishing shirt before.  Glad to make this discovery, though I will still get my fish from Costco and wear this shirt as I buy them.",
            "I bought this shirt to wear backpacking, and I\u2019m really putting it to the test. Sometimes I wear it for 2 weeks at a time without washing it, all while hiking and wearing a pack.It\u2019s held up great so far. I love how light the fabric is. The shirt keeps me cool in hot weather and serves as an adequate base layer in cold weather.There is some discoloration from sweat, but nothing too bad.I love how the sleeves roll up and down. It feels very secure and looks good.The shirt seems like it\u2019s going to live forever even thought I\u2019m asking a lot of it. There are no rips in the fabric despite the fact that I\u2019ve worn it through many forests and scrambled up and down rocks. There is plenty of room in the shoulders for movement.I am a 5\u20198\u201d female and I weigh 180. I ordered a men\u2019s medium because I wanted it to be big. I used to own a small and it was still big on me, but I like them this way so they are very airy. I will attach a photo.",
            "This is the second shirt of this type I've bought.  I use it in Baja for summer fishing on the Sea of Cortez where it is frequently 95+ degrees and humid in unfiltered sun. Me and the shirt are in the sun for about 8 hours. The material is very lightweight but blocks the sun at SPF 50 level, I think. The sleeves can be rolled up to short sleeves or left longsleeve. I leave them down and the material is very breathable so your forearms stay comfortable. I also turn up the collar to protect my neck. I wash it out at the end of the day and it's dry in a few hours and ready to go for the next day. It's nice to do so, but you don't need soap to wash out the sweat. I just rinse it well in fresh water and air dry it. My last shirt lasted 10 years (maybe that's about 200 days of use) and the only reason I got a new one is because the fabric is beginning to feel a little thin. But after all this use there are no rips, no seams coming undone, no buttons falling off...so, good construction.",
            "It's a nice shirt, but way too thick of a material for warm weather. I was expecting something lighter duty and more breathable like my nylon sun pants. Fabric also feels a bit rough and isn't brushed. Size all around seems fine, but the neck was super tight when fully buttoned, which is bad for a hot weather shirt. Going up a size would help but them the arms would be too long.I will have to return this shirt. It's just not good enough for what I need. I found a similar shirt from a different brand that is made from polyester and is much lighter and better in hot weather.",
            "I got this shirt for my husband for Christmas. I had bought/ordered one for my father a year or so before and my dad loves his. Uses his for golf a lot. My husband and I like to hike and camp and kayak and go birding and I figured this would be a great shirt for those types of activities. The shirt fit my husband perfectly, and the color looks just as it was shown. The shirt has performed very well and my husband says it is very comfortable. It seems very well made and has gone through the normal wash cycle and low setting on the dryer several times now with no show of wear or fading.It doesn't seem to wrinkle more than I would expect. We take it out and hang it up fairly quickly, but do not iron it.We are planning a trip to South America next late spring and this shirt will surely be packed as it will perfect on jungle hikes there. We will need something that breathes well and will dry quickly.  The shirt is also attractive, so it looks good tucked in to chinos with a belt as nicer casual attire for when in town.",
            "Most want to know the size! I am 6 feet, 175 lbs., and always wear a large, 34-35 sleeve. I ordered this Large long sleeve and the sleeves fit perfect. The rest fits a bit big, in the shoulders and body. I then ordered this short sleeve in Medium. Fit is more typical of a large, as compared side by side along all my large shirts. I included pictures and measurements because they tell the truth, I wish more reviewers would also! If sleeve length is not an issue, the medium fits best if you normally wear a large, unless you want that extra room. Being slim and trim, the medium is still more roomier than my other large shirts. Medium body is 24.5\", and large is 26\" wide. Length from armpit to tail, med. 15.5\", large is 16\". Shoulders from seam to seam is, med. 21.5\" and large 22.5\" The sleeve length of a long sleeve is 33.5. on a large. If someone else could post a review of the sleeve length of a medium, measured from collar to end of sleeve, that would help others!",
            "I had an exact shirt in different color in medium that I thought was a bit small for me, this Large feels just a bit too big...  but the large is more comfortable then the medium...  So, at 5-10 195# I would go for large over medium.  Otherwise, these are my favorite shirts now, casual but nice enough to wear to church!",
            "The build and quality of this Columbia shirt is everything you could expect. My only issue is fitment. I usually wear slim fit shirts and ordered this based on the image. When I received, the shirt sleeve length was good as well as chest but the cut around the stomach is \"baggy\". I'm 6'2\" 190lbs and this shirt doesn't fit like the photo. Regardless I'm keeping because it just seems all of these kind of shirts are \"baggy in the belly\" unlike the the sporty PFG Terminal Tackle shirts.",
            "I grew up in Florida and spent most of my time outside. As a result, I've got scars all over... I've had so much scraped, burned and cut off of my body, I look like I was in a knife fight with Pahoo-Ka-Ta-Wah. I need the protection when I'm out in the sun hiking, fishing, cutting the grass or whatever and I hate sunscreen or lotions.This shirt is well made, comfortable and looks good. Big pockets. Plenty of room, I wear Xlarge.  I would say the sizes are true. I'm 6' 2\", 210 lbs. This shirt fits great, is warm but not any warmer than a cotton long sleeve shirt. Unless there's a breeze it's going to be warm, especially if it's 90 degrees in the shade.I liked the first one so much I ordered three more.",
            "This is a great shirt! Yes, it runs large, but we bought our size anyway. As an ocean fishing shirt it is comfortable. And if he falls overboard can be seen easily. Kidding of course, no one wants the Captain over board. We got a fabulous deal for buying a not so popular color, the bright lime green.  Quality Columbia brand construction and product. Have several of these and they last forever, indestructible! Prefer the nylon fabric over polyester. A nylon cotton blend would be even better."

            "Picture quality: perfect! I washed the shirt 3 times and it hasn't faded at all yet.Size: I ordered a size large which is what I normally where in t-shirts, but it was extremely too big. I returned the shirt and ordered a size medium which was still a tiny bit too big, but I don't really like tight shirts anyways so it was fine. So ladies, please order one size smaller!My measurements: (in inches)Shoulders: 38.8\"Bra: 36DBust: 38.9\"Waist: 30.2\"Hips: 37\"Height: 5'2\"Shipping &amp; Returning: I had to return and replace my shirt to a size Medium because I ordered a size Large which was way too big. As long as you follow Amazons instructions, its very easy to return your product or get a refund. The shirt came in good packaging.Arrival: fast.I definitely recommend with product to anyone! But for women, order a size smaller.",

            "Was skeptical at first but when I tried it on, was I glad I went for it.  100% satisfied as you can see\u00a0in the \u00a0picture below of me and my girlfriend rocking it together.",
            "Ordered a Neon-Rainbow for my grandson.Predominant color is bright pink. Most of the shirt is covered with bright pink.  Not so on the picture of what the shirt will look approximately like.I didn\u2019t see it until it was delivered to grandson\u2019s home and washed before being worn (no, it did not change color from he wash. Would have returned it prior to washing if I\u2019d have seen it first. That said the quality for the price really is very good.Funny part is I ordered 2 at the same time and the 2nd one, a size child\u2019s S for a 5-6 year old was as advertised and fit my big 4 year old grandson just fine.I know it\u2019s tye dye and colors vary but be prepared for possibly something totally not expected.  In fairness to the seller and because I have to get a different one to replace the pink one, I'm ordering another in totally new color pattern.  Keeping my fingers crossed on the next one.",
            "The shirt is very bright and pretty. I threw it in the wash with my other clothes and everything came out fine. I also dried it in the dryer and I don't think it shrunk. I wasn't sure whether to get a M or L, but ended up going with the L in case it did shrink. I am 5'6\" 160' and 38x32x41. The L fits comfortably but definitely looks like I'm wearing a man's shirt. I think I will try a M next time. I gave 4 stars for the pretty design and fast shipping. The fabric is a little bit coarse though and I wish Colortone would offer a women's cut.",
            "Shirt is tiny for a large!!! Won't order anymore",
            "Love this. Exactly like picture. Read several comments about stiffness of material...it's because of the dye. Fabric softener should straighten that right out. Not a concern. That being said, I haven't washed this garment yet, but do expect it to shrink so I will wash in cold and lay flat to dry. No issue for me as I allow everything to air dry. This does run a little small. I ordered up 1 size and it fits fine. Not as loose as I'd like, but another size up would swallow me, not doubt. Up 1 size, air dry, no problems. Will update only if something changes. Very happy with this.",
            "Nice shirt, great quality.  The size runs a little bit small. If your size is Medium, I suggest next size.",
            "I loved the colors and the price is right.  I only gave it four stars because it fit a little small and it is advertised as thick cotton but I thought it was thin (I have some T-shirts that are much thicker).  I was going to send it back but my friend really liked it and it fit her so I gave her the first one I ordered and then I ordered a second one at the next size up.  The second one was a little larger than how I normally wear T-shirts but that is fine because I really like the extra roominess.  The T-shirt is very comfortable.  I am thinking about buying some more different colors."

            "This is the best shirt out of several brands of work shirts I have tried. I tried stocking up on Duluth Trading Long-Tail t-shirts because they had extra room called a 'tradesman fit' that's the opposite of a slim-fit shirt, that and they are a few inches longer on the bottom to prevent plumber's crack. The problem I ran into, price. Duluth Trading stuff is really nice, I mean REALLY NICE, but it's too expensive. From underwear to shirts to pants, I love their stuff to death but I went broke just buying 2-3 days worth of clothing.So began my search for alternatives. For a few days I wrapped my mind around all normal shirts being too short for me. One, I do not like plumbers crack and I bend down and kneel down a lot. Two, I conceal carry. Long shirts do 80-90% of the concealment for you if you have one, otherwise you have to dig a holster inside your pants and dig into your hip hard. Extra-tall sized shirts is a cheap alternative to the semi-custom size of the Duluth Longtail t-shirts. Next criteria I needed, price. Well pretty much everything is cheaper than Duluth, except maybe UnderArmour. But UnderArmour stuff is generally tight-fitting, so they lose that competition. These are shirts I bought in Tall size to supplement my existing longer Longtail t-shirts:Fruit-of-the-Loom (FOTL) cotton t-shirt from Wal-Mart: Average fit around my body, feels like advertized size. Thin material. Cost $8 in Wal-Mart, cheap but it's not a quality shirt at all and doesn't compete with the rest. It's just a grade lower. It's a cheap shirt but I would still gladly wear this if I didn't have my other work-shirts.Hane's Beefy-T's 6.10z t-shirt: Cheap, less than half price of Duluth. Material is too thin for me for a work-shirt. Yes, even in summer I like thick material as it wicks more sweat away. The material was too thin for a work shirt, same thickness as the FOTL shirt. Slightly trim fitting, after break-in they are what I consider 'normal' for their advertised size, slightly more trim than the FOTL. $10 with Prime.Dickie's Big-tall heavyweight crew neck short-sleeve: thicker than the Beefy-T, but just barely. Same price as Beefy-T. Very trim fitting for advertised size, I would consider these as a 'trim fit' for very lean individuals to be comfortable in. Even if I was in the same shape as I was at 21, these would still be tight fitting.Duluth Long-Tail t-shirt (did not order as tall, ordered at normal height): Thick material, comfortable in summer by wicking moisture better and comfortable in winter since it's thicker. Two or three inches taller than other standard-sized shirts which spoiled me and now I order tall shirts from all other companies. I consider them nearly perfect shirts year-round but the price, I only have 3 because after shipping they run over $20 a piece from Duluth, and no Duluth does not have Amazon Prime shipping. Nice, very nice, but expensive to build a wardrobe with.Carhartt Big-Tall Work Wear Short-Sleeve t-shirt: Material is as thick as Duluth shirt. I ordered this in tall, and is 1 inch longer than the standard-length Longtail-T from Duluth as a result. Not quite as generous fitting as the Duluth shirt, but it's a good bit larger girth than the other brand shirts. Material is slightly rougher feeling than the Duluth but still comfortable even when bending non-stop. Costs $15 with Amazon Prime, 50% more than the Hane's and Dickie's but at least $5 cheaper than a Duluth shirt.My summary is the Carhartt wins overall. Thick enough, long enough, and I tested mine in 100 degree heat recently. Like the Duluth shirt, the thicker material worked to help wick sweat away longer than thinner shirts will. But I live in a very humid area a few miles from the Mississippi river. Very humid Mid-Spring to Fall. Lots of people might not need to fight humidity this much. I can stock 4 Carhartt shirts for a buck or two cheaper than 3 Duluth shirts, and anyone who works outside often knows you can often go through two shirts or maybe even three on a hot work-day in order to keep dry. So that means I can stock up on 12 shirts instead of 9 going Carhartt to carry me through a whole week without running out of shirts, even when a certain family member (you know who you are in each family) hides them in a clothes pile somewhere for a few days. The savings is enough to make a big difference for anyone buying a few shirts.",
            "Once again, not disappointed with the Carhartt shirts I purchased to be embroidered for our construction business. Hunter Green pictured on top of Carbon Heather, Dark Cobalt Blue, and then the navy, all Carhartt brand and original fit. Size LARGE men's and the size is 24 inches under the arm and 32 inches long- from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the shirt. Also bought some size large Guilden brand shirts, and the Carhartt is an inch wider, longer, and the arms are way wider as well. Great quality and I know from past purchases that they hold up with heavy use and heavy washing.",
            "TERRIBLE QUALITY SIZING CONTROL I have purchased these numerous times I re-READ the TAGLESS TAG in the shirt SHOCKER it's clearly Stamped 3 X LARGE TALL. it was 7\" longer &amp; at least 6\" inches WIDER than the old ones I have made in GUATEMALA (these were also stamped exactly the same &amp; made in Guatemala if you happen to weigh 300-500 pounds and are 6' 8\"+ these will probably Fit YOU.SIDENOTE=I am 6' 4\" 260#  58\"chest  &amp; my regular size is 3XLT in this Carhartt workwear Pocket T.the shirt is a nice heavy weight so I am hoping if I order 2XL they will fit like the 3XLT used to Thank Goodness for PRIME &amp;  Free Returns",
            "Normally I wear a size large T shirt so I ordered the large. It was a little too big so I ordered a Medium. When the Medium arrived it was exactly the same size as the large, so I ordered a Small. When the Small came it was exactly the same size as the Medium and the Large. There is only one size they are just marked with S.M.L. Since I only use these for working in the yard it's not a big deal, but all of them are the same size.",
            "As you can see from the label this shirt made in Guatemala is NOT 100% cotton, nor is the color anywhere as light as the heather grey. You sent me Desert grey. The other two made in Haiti and Mexico supposedly were, but all feel pretty rough like polyester!",
            "Great shirts and its about all I wear. I liked the light duty shirt but it lagged a little too much with all the junk I carry so these are it. Summer and long sleeves in the fall and winter. I've been a customer since I was a kid. The offshore waters here in the northeast are unforgiving most of the time so I wear their stuff on  the outside too. On these,no ripped off pockets or torn armpits,they wash well and you can't beat them for comfort. I've got cigar burn holes in them and the holes don't stretch out. The little burnholes are still little burn holes when they com out of the wash,good stuff and this is a great deal.",
            "Love these shirts. They wash up well, don't shrink, the neck stays tight. Sure, they are pricier than other tshirts, but well worth the extra money. Others will be long relegated to the rag bag or sleep shirts for your family and these will still be going strong. Bite the bullet and order a few. You won't regret it.I ordered several of these and the Dickies. Very close. These were cut about an inch longer. Other than that, they were virtually identical. The length made the difference for me. Dickies went back and I ordered more Carhartts.But, be advised, they are a heavier material than most. Too heavy to be worn as an undershirt.",
            "My husband is 6' 3\" and 300+ lbs. He requires a shirt with a pocket, a long torso to tuck in and one that doesn't stretch out or lose it's shape. He is very happy with these shirts. He isn't a fan of advertising a brand name but is impressed with the quality.",
            "The sizes are unlike any other manufacturer I've purchased from.  These shirts don't just run large, mine seemed to be SEVERAL sizes larger than what was indicated on the label.  Despite being \"regular fit\" this thing fits like a tarp, and the length goes all the way past my knees, it's ridiculous.  This shirt is so oversized it's laughably bad.  Not only does it look terrible, but it would be impossible/dangerous to work in because the loose, draping fabric is just begging to get caught on anything and everything.  I've loved Carhartt stuff for years, but something is has gone seriously wrong with their design and manufacturing.  I won't buy this brand ever again.",
            "Carhartt gear is typically top notch but the sizing was WAY off and the material was uncomfortable. I'm 6'5\" 260# normally wearing XL shirts and their XL Tall fit like a giant potato sack that hung halfway down my thigh. Supposed to be loose and long, but with this being one of their smaller Tall fit shirts I can only imagine the 3XT is essentially a queen size bed sheet. Decided to run it through an extra hot wash for a little shrinkage and give it a go. Helped a little but not enough to not make me look like a little kid wearing my dad's old T. Wore it while doing an outdoor project and after 10 minutes of sweating the shirt became gritty and incredibly uncomfortable. Made for a mediocre towel the rest of the day as I opted to go shirtless instead. Only slight positive i can think of is the material is thick enough to keep you warm. It retained water very well and weighed ~5 lbs by the end of the day."

            "Highly recommend this product, purchased this for my wife 2 weeks ago along with the iPhone X. Also had a tempered glass screen protector on it...anyways, I dropped her off at the front door of the house today and after she closed the door she accidentally dropped the phone and it of course landed under the back tire of the car. Unknowingly I proceeded to drive to park and run over it! Thankfully it was perfectly fine! The screen protector however didn\u2019t get so lucky. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the performance of this case! Recommend to everyone! -Rebeca\u2019s husband",
            "Doesn't fit properly on my iPhone Xs. The rubber buckles around the buttons. It is real loose the volume and on and off button. This case does not fit properly, the edges are exposed and flimsy. I\u2019d be worried if I drop it. This is not for iPhone Xs. I am hugely disappointed. Openings at the bottom for mike is bigger than required (looks like they sent the cover for iPhone Xs). Camera and apple logo on the back of the phone do not properly fit at the center of the openings.  This is a huge disappointment since its a costly cover then it should fit in the iPhone Xs.",
            "This case is great! Sleek but feels protective. It has a \"lip\" that goes over the phone screen so if you drop it, the case hits the ground first and not the screen. I had no issues with it not fitting as previous reviewers mentioned, this one fits perfectly over the X with no bulges or button alignment issues.I've used the Commuter Otterbox for every previous iPhone I owned and they were always great, so I hope this one continues to work just as well!",
            "I bought this case because I had the same one for my iPhone 6s and it worked with a new baby so well. My baby would throw it and drop it all the time and nothing ever happened. For years I didn\u2019t have one crack.  I got the new iphone XS two weeks ago and just a few days into using this case the screen is cracked. You can tell that this case isn\u2019t as good as the older version of the same model because it doesn\u2019t come up as high around the sides of the screen so it can\u2019t provide as much protection. I\u2019m not sure why otter box changed their design for the commuter but I am returning this and paying to get my screen fixed :(((((",
            "Pros\u2022 Slim but provides the perfect protection to your iPhone X.\u2022 Two layers case.\u2022 Hole in the back for the ones who like to show off the Apple logo.\u2022 Feels good in your hands with a great grip.\u2022 Even if your phone has a tempered glass, thanks to its raised beveled edge, it will keep the screen safe if the phone fell on a flat surface.\u2022 Provides great protection to your back camera thanks to the raised beveled edge.\u2022 The buttons are very responsive.\u2022 Protects your lighting port against dust and debris, thanks to a nice cap.\u2022 Wireless charger friendly, I am using a Choetech.Cons\u2022 Might slip on some hard surface.",
            "Overview: This case has protected my iPhone X from numerous drops.Pros:  I'm not an overtly clumsy person.  But for some reason I feel like I need to drop my $1,000 phone onto the ground from waist to chest height.  Not a single scratch has appeared from the numerous drops.Cons:  The reason I keep dropping my phone is the hard outer shell is super slick.  Imagine dipping your hands into olive oil and then picking up your phone.  That is how slick this case is.  There is no texture to the outer shell.  You will accidentally drop your phone with this case...numerous times.  The good news is, it is awesome at protecting the phone from the inevitable drops.",
            "I do not believe this is a legit Otterbox, or the quality of Otterbox has changed. With all my previous Otterbox cases the two part system has worked really well and both layers feel of quality. This case has a cheap rubber that is not flexible as they have been before and and doesn\u2019t fit like a glove. The plastic is lacking the support to keep the rubber tightly against the phone especially on the top half of the phone.",
            "I bought the symmetry case clear and it was scratched up in a week. This case has more protection and is just as slim! Weighs more yes, but it\u2019s worth it. 1,000 dollar phone deserves this case. Don\u2019t be cheap!  Plus you get the opening in the back for the Apple LogoWorks with WIRELESS CHARGING TOO",
            "I got this for my new iPhone Xs as I loved the Commuter case on my previous iPhone 7.  Overall I did not feel like this case fit the phone well. Not sure if this is an issue with the Xs or just the overall design of the case.  The rubber portion felt loose and spongy, especially around the side button and camera while the outer plastic piece felt like it was too small and never felt completely secure over the rubber.  Things just didn't line up or look tidy.I just ordered and received the Otterbox Symmetry Case which feels perfect on my phone.  Seems like a much more secure fit and doesn't seem to sacrifice anything on protection.  Love Otterbox and their products, but the Commuter on the iPhone Xs is a \"miss\" for me",
            "I was really excited to get this case but disappointed when I got it. I have always had a Defender case and this doesn\u2019t feel as safe as I\u2019m used to. There is only rubber on the inside and slightly on the edges so I doesn\u2019t grip that well when holding or using on the side. Also there is no clear protector for the circle in the back which is what made me decide to return it. Great case for someone who is careful with their phone just not someone who wants to feel protected."

            "Years ago I had a small epiphany: I realized that every time I went into the t-shirt drawer to grab a shirt, I was always (almost subconsciously) hoping that my favorite couple of shirts was in there, and I would be a bit disappointed when I had to grab another one. So I decided that going forward my wardrobe would contain ONLY my favorite types of shirt.The main problem with that is the fact that the overwhelming majority of t-shirts (regardless of how much you pay) are total crap. They are thin and flimsy, the fit isn\u2019t good, and they aren\u2019t as comfortable as they should be.So, ever since then I\u2019ve tried to find the best possible t-shirts and this is one of them. The other is the Hanes \u201cBeefy-T\u201d but those are super thick 100% cotton and not ideal for all situations.These Russel shirts are the BEST blended shirts in the world (meaning they are made with a blend of cotton and synthetic fibers). They fit EXCELLENT. They are just lose enough to be comfortable but not so loose that they look sloppy. That means that you can wear the shirt out (if you want) and not just wear them to bum around the house. The fabric is very durable even after years of use and the colors don\u2019t fade. The synthetic fibers keep you cool and the cotton feels great agains your skin.I highly recommend these shirts.",
            "I bought these because my XL shirts are too big for me and I needed to go down a size. I usually buy Hemp shirts because of the comfort...but at $30/shirt I was willing to take a chance on something else. I've had Russell products in the past and I recall them being the go-to outfitter when I was  in school. These are awesome to wear during the summer and to the gym. Mine are holding up nicely in the wash and the color has not faded nor have they shrunk. These are so cheap that if you are on the fence just do it. I originally wanted to buy Under Armour t-shirts.....with Russell I was able to buy 3 for the price of one UA shirt. I like the logo on bottom and some have the logo on the sleeve...all 3 of my Russell shirts are different but all 3 are holding up fine and look good. I'd say this is a medium weight shirt....i've had thinner.",
            "This is my \"Goldie-Locks\" of t-shirts. I wanted a t-shirt that was ultra comfortable that I could work out in that wasn't too thin or too thick, not too long or too short, not too loose or too tight. I tried multiple brands and figured out that these Russell Athletic shirts were the ones that fit my needs. I have broad shoulders and a large back and chest. These shirts fit my body shape very well. I don't care for the dry-fit shirts. I like the feel of cotton or a cotton/poly blend against my skin. In addition to working out these are great for every day wear and lounging around in as well.",
            "Somewhat thinner fabric material than other colors in this product line, which does not fare well in the wash after  a few rounds of washing - fabric pills. I bought this product thinking that a polyester mix fabric would be pill resistant, unlike typical cotton fabric, but not so, it seems. Incidentally, I bought the same product line (different color) years back from a store, and they still look like new after dozens of washes. Im still evaluating other colors in this line that I bought along with this one, will update this review later.",
            "I've owned a number of Russell brand t-shirts over the years and these are made from by far the thinnest material I've ever seen in one of their shirts. I don't know why men's t-shirts all of a sudden started getting made from tissue paper thin material. I bought some Russell tees just a few years ago and they were made from a much heavier material. Maybe these are specifically meant for Amazon?It's still pretty well made and there's nothing wrong with these shirts, but I prefer a heavier shirt. They also run a bit small for my liking. They call them \"cotton\" shirts but they are actually a cotton/polyester blend? If you're a fan of modern, paper thin tees that are kind of tight then these will be fine for you.",
            "I buy a lot of Russel Tee Shirts.  This time I ordered 3 different colors.  Navy, Dark Green and Maroon.  I would say these are OK but not a lot to brag about.  The colors are representative of what is advertised, they do fit as expected but the material seemed a bit thin to me.  Fair price but for Russell, I was a bit disappointed.",
            "Worn once, for all I know it will fall apart, second wash.  HOWEVER, I very much like this T shirt.  I am six foot, 165, skinny and strong.  A medium fits me perfectly, not tight, not loose.  For eight bucks total?  Give this shirt a try.  You can buy four for the same price as one Nike or UA wicking shirt.  EDITED after receiving additional shirts.....  I've lowered my rating from five to four stars.  My first shirt was \"vintage heather navy\", and appears to be a slightly better quality material than the two colors which I ordered subsequently.  And given what appears to be a slightly thinner product, the medium is just slightly too tight on my mature chest.  Still a bargain, but I'll be careful about how and where I wear them.  If you're a slim college kid with big guns, get this shirt.",
            "So far these T shirts fit almost like the original over 10 year old shirts with no rips or tears.I looked up Russel Athletic and found that they were still in business. Two things really piss me off though.  My original shirts that last forever are made in USA. Their add eludes that the shirts are still USA. It pisses me off that their shirts are no longer made in the USA. It sickens me that a manufacturer formerly of the USA who produce A # 1 quality garments! This defies the fact that US does not make quality goods! Shame on you Rusell Athletics- Shame on you! Greed took over. You make more$$$$ but you put people out of work!  Evan",
            "Like many of the reviews here say these T-shirts are not what they used to be. Maybe its just the wrong style but overall I am not pleased with the purchase. I have worn the Russell  athletic T's for many, many years because of their heavy duty material that always held up to the hard work I do.  These shirts are just like the all too common cheap synthetic feeling stretch cotton that you find at bargain stores. They are very thin, not like they used to be. Sweat in it once and its time to change your shirt because you are soaked. I wore the grey one once and developed holes in the front from just one day of normal wear.When it comes to a work/workout shirt I have never minded sacrificing comfort for functionality and while the Russel athletic T's of the past were not uncomfortable I could care less about how super soft the shirts were. These feel flimsy because they are.  I almost wondered if these were counterfeits.",
            "The quality was ok for my needs.  The sizing however was WAY off.  Instead of being a 4X they were more like a XL. I kept checking the size to make sure I had ordered correctly. I held them up to a 3X that had been washed several times and the 3X was approx. 1.5\" bigger on each side.  Had I not already removed the tags I would have returned them, instead I will pass them on to someone else."

            "Highly recommend this product, purchased this for my wife 2 weeks ago along with the iPhone X. Also had a tempered glass screen protector on it...anyways, I dropped her off at the front door of the house today and after she closed the door she accidentally dropped the phone and it of course landed under the back tire of the car. Unknowingly I proceeded to drive to park and run over it! Thankfully it was perfectly fine! The screen protector however didn\u2019t get so lucky. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the performance of this case! Recommend to everyone! -Rebeca\u2019s husband",
            "Doesn't fit properly on my iPhone Xs. The rubber buckles around the buttons. It is real loose the volume and on and off button. This case does not fit properly, the edges are exposed and flimsy. I\u2019d be worried if I drop it. This is not for iPhone Xs. I am hugely disappointed. Openings at the bottom for mike is bigger than required (looks like they sent the cover for iPhone Xs). Camera and apple logo on the back of the phone do not properly fit at the center of the openings.  This is a huge disappointment since its a costly cover then it should fit in the iPhone Xs.",
            "This case is great! Sleek but feels protective. It has a \"lip\" that goes over the phone screen so if you drop it, the case hits the ground first and not the screen. I had no issues with it not fitting as previous reviewers mentioned, this one fits perfectly over the X with no bulges or button alignment issues.I've used the Commuter Otterbox for every previous iPhone I owned and they were always great, so I hope this one continues to work just as well!",
            "I bought this case because I had the same one for my iPhone 6s and it worked with a new baby so well. My baby would throw it and drop it all the time and nothing ever happened. For years I didn\u2019t have one crack.  I got the new iphone XS two weeks ago and just a few days into using this case the screen is cracked. You can tell that this case isn\u2019t as good as the older version of the same model because it doesn\u2019t come up as high around the sides of the screen so it can\u2019t provide as much protection. I\u2019m not sure why otter box changed their design for the commuter but I am returning this and paying to get my screen fixed :(((((",
            "Pros\u2022 Slim but provides the perfect protection to your iPhone X.\u2022 Two layers case.\u2022 Hole in the back for the ones who like to show off the Apple logo.\u2022 Feels good in your hands with a great grip.\u2022 Even if your phone has a tempered glass, thanks to its raised beveled edge, it will keep the screen safe if the phone fell on a flat surface.\u2022 Provides great protection to your back camera thanks to the raised beveled edge.\u2022 The buttons are very responsive.\u2022 Protects your lighting port against dust and debris, thanks to a nice cap.\u2022 Wireless charger friendly, I am using a Choetech.Cons\u2022 Might slip on some hard surface.",
            "Overview: This case has protected my iPhone X from numerous drops.Pros:  I'm not an overtly clumsy person.  But for some reason I feel like I need to drop my $1,000 phone onto the ground from waist to chest height.  Not a single scratch has appeared from the numerous drops.Cons:  The reason I keep dropping my phone is the hard outer shell is super slick.  Imagine dipping your hands into olive oil and then picking up your phone.  That is how slick this case is.  There is no texture to the outer shell.  You will accidentally drop your phone with this case...numerous times.  The good news is, it is awesome at protecting the phone from the inevitable drops.",
            "I do not believe this is a legit Otterbox, or the quality of Otterbox has changed. With all my previous Otterbox cases the two part system has worked really well and both layers feel of quality. This case has a cheap rubber that is not flexible as they have been before and and doesn\u2019t fit like a glove. The plastic is lacking the support to keep the rubber tightly against the phone especially on the top half of the phone.",
            "I bought the symmetry case clear and it was scratched up in a week. This case has more protection and is just as slim! Weighs more yes, but it\u2019s worth it. 1,000 dollar phone deserves this case. Don\u2019t be cheap!  Plus you get the opening in the back for the Apple LogoWorks with WIRELESS CHARGING TOO",
            "I got this for my new iPhone Xs as I loved the Commuter case on my previous iPhone 7.  Overall I did not feel like this case fit the phone well. Not sure if this is an issue with the Xs or just the overall design of the case.  The rubber portion felt loose and spongy, especially around the side button and camera while the outer plastic piece felt like it was too small and never felt completely secure over the rubber.  Things just didn't line up or look tidy.I just ordered and received the Otterbox Symmetry Case which feels perfect on my phone.  Seems like a much more secure fit and doesn't seem to sacrifice anything on protection.  Love Otterbox and their products, but the Commuter on the iPhone Xs is a \"miss\" for me",
            "I was really excited to get this case but disappointed when I got it. I have always had a Defender case and this doesn\u2019t feel as safe as I\u2019m used to. There is only rubber on the inside and slightly on the edges so I doesn\u2019t grip that well when holding or using on the side. Also there is no clear protector for the circle in the back which is what made me decide to return it. Great case for someone who is careful with their phone just not someone who wants to feel protected."

            "I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.",
            "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.",
            "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(",
            "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.",
            "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.",
            "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.",
            "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.",
            "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad",
            "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.",
            "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"

            "Wow, how can you mess up this bad? These are NOT the same sweatpants they used to have! We ordered from this same place, same company, same way on Amazon by pushing \"reorder this item\" and they are completely different pants. Knock-offs maybe? Our previous ones were awesome and thick, nicely made BUT these are horrible: they are paper thin with no fleece or felt on the inside, big thick exposing nasty stinky rubber waistband, they fit really odd in all the wrong places. I should return them but seems more a hassle than anything.Guess I'll try and wear them as scrap pants I suppose. I see this a lot on Amazon lately, you can order one thing from the same place and it's great and then the next order is completely different.",
            "Like so many others here, I'm fed up with these pants. The waistband thread rips out at first washing, and at third washing the fabric has pulled away from the waistband elastic. By the time you get it out of the dryer the threads have encircled the legs and you can't get them apart.There is a solution, though it will cost more and is not Prime-eligible: Look up Champion Men's Closed-Bottom Jersey Pant (yes, it's exactly the same description as this pant here). The ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) is B003XDTAWU. The model number is p2235. The waistbands are made differently; they are much more durable and have given me much less trouble. They are made in Honduras, whereas the rip-apart pants on this page are made in El Salvador.Unfortunately, the better ones cost $17.90 plus $6.99 shipping. But for people who rely on these pants as my husband does, they are much more reliable and worth the extra charge.",
            "Have to give one star because the trousers have  2 inches different lengths . A picture is shown below.I am surprised at such a stupid mistake and very curious of how it happened though do understand everyone makes mistakes .",
            "I've tried several different sweatpants over the years and having used them at the gym, for playing badminton, as sleep/daily wear etc. etc. I've come down to some key requirements. These are probably the only sweatpants that fit all of them:1&gt; full-loop inner drawstring at the waist (full-loop: not a split drawstring that could get twisted in the dryer or lost in the seam by mistake; I don't even tie it - just pull it a bit and leave the rest to the elastic in the seam) (inner: not an outer drawstring that would lurk from under my gym t-shirt)2&gt; comfy ankle elastic (comfy: not a tight-fit at the ankle - so it's easy to pull on and off especially after an exhausting workout/game) (elastic: not a drawstring at the ankles that I would have to constantly conscious about while moving around in the gym or any new place I go to)3&gt; light-weight material (it's not heavy and/or warm - just ok to keep the cold at bay but it's not built for that)4&gt; not-irritable (and polyester irritates you, these come in a color variant with more cotton)5&gt; have held up pretty well over 6 months of constant use and machine wash+dry (may have faded a bit but the discoloration must have been uniform to have gone quite unnoticed (talking solely about the granite heather variant - haven't tried the others)) and look like they'll last me at least a year.Considering that I am very lazy at writing reviews, I must say I'm a very satisfied customer. I'm ordering 2 more of these sweatpants since even after 6 months I could not find another product to match my sort of specific requirements. If only they came with a length option I would have ordered some for my dad, who wears the same waist but is shorter in height and such closed-ankle sweatpants cannot be altered like the open-ankle ones. At the price-point I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a decent pair of sweatpants.",
            "Fit and fabric are the same, but unfortunately the waistband is much wider than before and not completely fabric covered, so not as comfortable or attractive.  Not sure if this is a permanent change to all Champion  jersey closed bottom pants and not sure reason for change.  We'll see how the consumer reacts to this.  Hope Champion strongly considers returning to the original design.",
            "This might have been the most disappointing pair of sweats I have ever purchased. The material is some blend rather than the all cotton sweats I have owned in the past. The strings that are meant to hold the pant up are a complete joke, made of cheap material, they want to break the first time I cinch them up. The cut of the pant kind of flares out round the seat and tapers down towards the ankle. A cheap imitation of the old sweats that used to be available in athletic stores. Definitely not what I was looking for, and I ordered two of them. It seems that sporting goods stores want you to buy a $75 pair of designer sweat pants which don't feel right going to the gym in. I could not find basic cotton sweatpants that fit the way I prefer so I opted to buy from a picture from Amazon, and though the picture seemed to be what I was looking for, it was not in fact what I expected.",
            "I initially was happy with these sweatpants. After a couple months though, I now realize that these definitely are NOT 100% cotton as specifically advertised.  At first, I thought the discomfort I experienced when wearing them perhaps was due to some new-fabric sizing that did not wash out completely. This obviously polyester blend is uncomfortable because the fibers rub the skin and also stick into the skin. They have become even more uncomfortable with additional washings.",
            "I just got these. They\u2019re nice pants. But don\u2019t make a mistake and buy these if you\u2019re looking for fleece material. These are cotton pants. I didn\u2019t realize that when I chose these. I thought they were fleece material. But it\u2019s ok. We\u2019re going into hot weather now, so these are ok to wear. They fit ok. They feel ok too. I like it that they have pockets. But they are not deep pockets. So with all that in mind, that\u2019s why I gave it 4 stars. I tried looking for black sweatpants all around my area and nobody seems to have what I\u2019m looking for OR just don\u2019t have them at all. Especially Walmart. I was shocked Walmart didn\u2019t have Anything at all. That\u2019s usually the first place you look for cheaper items that you want. But these pants aren\u2019t cheap! The elastic around the waist is pretty well made. So I\u2019m happy with that. So if you\u2019re looking for cotton sweats, then these are for you and I recommend them. I didn\u2019t feel any polyester in these pants and they are not a sheen type of material. I don\u2019t like sheen.",
            "I've been a loyal user of these jersey pants for at least the past several years.  Unfortunately, my older pairs finally began to fall apart, so I bought two pair of these new jersey pants to replace them.  Immediately upon receiving them I had to send one pair back because I couldn't help but notice the legs were CONSIDERABLY shorter than the other pair (despite both being the exact same sizes).  That was problem #1 and easily remedied by the return, but that one experience was a \"quality control\" red flag for me from day one.  Then, immediately upon starting to wear the pair that I decided to keep, I began to wonder about the construction quality of the waist band because the elastic is no longer sewn/wrapped INSIDE of the jersey fabric like it used to be on the older version of these pants, and the stitching also just didn't seem very tightly sewn.  Well, sure enough, here I am just a couple months after receiving them and already the stitching on the second pair that I kept has begun to to unravel!  The older pairs of these jersey pants that I used to own were FAR better made in every way, and they each lasted me several years before the \"stretchiness\" of the elastic on those older pairs finally broke down.  These new pants:  very poorly made!Bottom line:  Don't waste your money on these!  These pants are just one example of a Champion product that was once made with decent quality, but clearly no longer is.  Guess that's what happens when you contract out to the lowest bidder!  Time to start searching for jersey pants made by a different, better quality brand.",
            "I would stay away from this brand and these sweatpants.  My husband only had this pair for a month and the stitching was already coming undone.  I purchased two of these at the same time one in a different color and that one did the same thing. I returned that one because it was less than a month that he had these pants.  Very disappointed, because these are light and comfortable, but then this issue of the stitching coming undone was unacceptable. I would not recommend these you will be hating yourself for buying these."

            "In terms of my torso, the shirts fit just as I desired.  A bit snug (and stretchy), but still comfortable.  But know that the shirts do run long.  Where most shirts stop roughly where around the pockets of my normal jeans, these shirts extend to cover my entire fly (zipper) of the same jeans and a bit more.  It also resembles one of those super sexy tight and short dress-shirts that girls sometimes wear, just to give you a better picture.The material is the usual thickness; not too thick or too thin.  The bottom of the shirt is also hemmed.  And yes, it's tagless.  The tag is printed on the actual shirt, no extra material or stitching.In short, as I use these as undershirts, the length isn't a problem as it will be tucked into my pants.UPDATE: After roughly 15 washes, the shirts are still holding strong.  They've held their size and stretch well.  Stitching still looks like it did day 1, and the shirts have not faded at all.  I've gone as far as to order 2 additional packs of these shirts as they fit well, feel great, and are well made.  To date, I have no complaints, large or small.Purchased this product a total of 4 times: April 2017, Nov 2017, Jan 2018, Dec 2018I wear tank tops daily under my work shirt, meaning they get washed OFTEN.  They do expand, but it takes a lot of washes, and even then the expansion is really just the loss of the stretchiness.  The shirts basically go from slim fit to normal fit.  I will continue buying these shirts as they feel great, wear well, and last a suitable amount of washes.",
            "I am female. They make women's undershirts too short, and cheap ones for women are never 100% cotton (which is LAME), so I thought I'd try this. Ladies: It's a fairly deep scoop neck, but probably sits too high on the actual breast part to wear as a cami under anything really girly, but for regular under-shirt performance I think it's great! I like wearing A shirts to bed. Good news: covers most of your butt to give you that held together feeling. Bad news: arm holes are cut deep into the chest which could give some girls too much side boob. Wash them first if you want to avoid reaching escape velocity. I wear them tight so they don't get bunch under your clothes and to get extra support.",
            "1. These run VERY small. I am tall and thin (6'4\" 180) and usually buy Hanes undershirts. Their large size fits me well but they stretch out too quickly. I've never had a problem before buying undershirts that are described as long-hemmed for tucking in. But these are on the small side and they shrink A LOT. I tried it on out of the package and was very optimistic, so I washed them all, and putting one on out of the wash I don't think they're going to work - pretty sure this won't stay tucked. It's that short now!2. Other reviews mention this; they are not the softest fabric. Perhaps this would improve with repeated wear/wash cycles that I won't get to because of the size problem. I wouldn't describe it as scratchy or rough, necessarily, just... not soft.3. Assorted colors really means assorted. You don't just get what's shown here. I bought two four-packs: Black, Light Gray, Royal Blue, Royal Red. Second pack had Navy, Navy, Royal Blue, Light Gray. Take your chances!I guess you get what you pay for. I was happy to have a slightly less luxurious feel and to roll the dice on colors, for the price. But, they are just too small. So, bottom line: beware. These are MUCH smaller than other brands' large undershirts.",
            "The shirt size I ordered fits me as expected. However, the shirt colors that was sent was different from the one that was advertised. I was expecting the brown and navy blue but received red and royal blue instead. Not good.",
            "These are pretty nice basic tanks, especially for the price...which if we're honest makes each tank top work out to be about $2.75....and I'm not even sure it makes any kind of sense in our world that I can pay $2.75 for a tank top and then have the audacity to JUDGE it...bwaKeep in mind that $2.75 includes the shipping to me cause I have Prime..ha...wow.....kind of makes me feel like it should be a 5 star review just for that...hmm..Annnnyways, they are a close fitting Large. As they are meant to be undershirts I suspect. Not loose and baggy.They are for my husband who is wide shouldered, slim build, 200 lbs and 6 feet tall. He first tried them on before we washed them and they were slightly loose and then after washing and drying they shrunk up a bit to a perfect fit. Think athletic fit, no bagginess.Great for exercise or under looser shirts.The hem of these tanks are just raw edge that has been overlock stitched. Very basic...but again...$2.75 a tank!The colours stayed true after several washings already so that is cool.The photo doesn't do the colour mix justice, they are deeper, richer colours. The red is more super hero red than maroon and the blue is very blue..again, think superheros.I did experience a small problem after the first wash. The stitching came half undone in the shoulder of one of the tanks...we inspected the others and their shoulder stitching stayed tight so I am assuming it was a fluke...but again these are your basic cheap tank and for the price don't be expecting top quality stitching and finishing.They're comfortable too. My husband usually wears a looser tank for every day wear but for exercising, Yoga etc, he wanted the slimmer fit so the shirt wasn't hiking up and getting in his way. The ribbed quality of these make them stay put.So, all in all very nice!I'd buy again if we needed them.I docked a star for the unfinished hem and shoulder seam that I had to fix after the very first wash.",
            "I have been buying these very undershirts for sometime now. Amazon - as usual - has the best prices too.Amazon also makes buying these and many other underclothing items a fail-safe purchase thanks to their free-return offer.The Medium size (showing 'MMM' on the undershirt) feels very good against your skin. It stretches nicely to fityour body and probably are best for the more fit/athletic shaped guys at least in the Medium size I get.Shipping as always for Prime members was fast and I got them in 2 days. Do note that they tend to be on the long sidewhere the Medium size is 34\" long out of the box. It does shrink a little after a couple of washes, but being thin fabric itwill rise some when you wear it and not really remain the full 34\" inches down.",
            "I'm a bigger guy and have very few problems when I order a 3xl. Usually, anything this size is roomy and loose on me.Not these.I probably should have tried one on first but they looked big enough as I removed them from the packaging. After I tossed them in the wash, I tried one on and it was so tight, I looked like Philip Seymour Hoffman's character in Boogie Nights.Definitely would not recommend these at all as the material is cheap and ill fitting.",
            "My 4-star review is only for one reason: the colors I received were not the one's pictured on the description page. I got 2 out of the 4 colors pictured. Unfortunately, it looks like this may have been my fault. Upon a closer read of the description, it looks like this was mentioned -- \"Items are assorted and comes with colors different from the image.\"Aside from 2 unwanted colors (a bright red one and an ugly shade of blue). The size fits me just right and feels just fine on me. I use them to work out at the gym. Nice snug fit. Hopefully they don't shrink in the wash as others have said on here. I'll be sure to air-dry them to avoid possible shrinkage since they are 100% cotton.Anyway, recommend getting but be aware you may not get the colors you want.",
            "[UPDATED REVIEW 2016.11]I have now owned these tank-tops for a year.  Although they are slightly less abrasive after many washes, they are still snug.  They have not shrunk or stretched out and have for the most part remained the same size.  I still recommend ordering a size larger if you prefer a looser fit.[ORIGINAL REVIEW 2015.11]As previous reviewers have suggested, it is a bit snug however I prefer my tank-tops to be this way.  Buy a size or two sizes larger if you like a looser fit.  My only complaint is that the texture is slightly abrasive despite being 100% cotton.  I have only owned them for 5 months so I am hoping it will break in with time.",
            "I like FOTL products because they are pretty good and cheap.  HOWEVER, it's rediculous that they are never the same product twice.  A-frame shirts...no hem at bottom, then hemmed bottom; sturdy shoulder stitches, then weak shoulder stitches; average sized arm holes, then rediculously large arm holes.  Same with the boxer briefs...good overlap on front flap, then no overlap on front flap, then good again; large fits, then large doesn't fit; cotten feels like cotten, then cotten doesn't feel like cotten.  It's as if FOLT is bought out and moved to a new country every few months.  Crazy.  So why am I still ordering them?  Because it's not always bad changes; sometimes they get better."

            "Awesome shirt.  The kids got it for my husband and he loved it.  Great fit and great quality.  we got an XL.  My husband is 6'2\" and weight 250 pounds and a muscular build.  Hope this review helps",
            "I didn\u2019t see it in person as it was a gift sent straight to my dad through Amazon. He said he liked it! Ordered a 2XL. He\u2019s 6\u20195\u201d",
            "For some reason grandfathers love these types of shirts or at the least the ones in my family do. My daughter is three and we get one for them every year, usually whatever Target has at the time but this one was much better. Arrived quickly and the price and quality are great. I would absolutely buy from this company again.",
            "Shipped much faster than I expected, looks great and the base is a standard Glidan shirt if that helps anyone figure out sizing. I ordered 3x and looks tts. Very happy with the product, have a hard time finding good Pop Pop gifts!",
            "I actually purchased 3 of these tees, for our nephew-in-law, his dad &amp; my husband for Father's Day. They are really nice &amp; printed very well, not just some cheap stamping on the front. They are light, a perfect weight for summertime. The size, large, seems about right. If in doubt, order one size up, I'd guess. But for us, these are all fine &amp; I'm sure they'll be a big hit come Father's Day weekend.",
            "I ordered this shirt as a gift form someone for Christmas.  I was completely surprised how soft and what great quality it was.  I read some of the reviews that said that it ran small, so I ordered a size up.  I believe I could have ordered the regular size as I believe they are true to size.",
            "This shirt came and was extremely wide and short.  We purchased a 2XL for my father who is 6'2\".  The shirt was several inches too short and extremely baggy.  The company quickly refunded the money.  We would buy this again if it was available in tall sizes.",
            "Such a cute t-shirt! My dad loved it! I think the large runs a little large around the waist, but the arms looks like a typical large. Overall, excellent and well made shirt! Fabric is soft and the printing is done really well.",
            "I bought this for my dad on Father\u2019s Day. He\u2019s about 5\u20199 and 280 lbs, he\u2019s a big fella.  After reading the reviews I Opted to go up a size and it fit perfectly.",
            "The idea for the shirt is pretty neat. Other reveiws said the shirt was too small. I bought xl but really should have got medium. The logo sits in the middle of the belly rather than the chest. The size combined with the logo placement means this shirt wont be worn out of the house."

            "I have had this protector as I feel it is was necessary to get it for my iPhone 8 plus. Being a recent convert from a Samsung Galaxy 5, I could no longer feel comfortable being responsibly gentle with an even larger and significantly heavier phone, so I looked for a case that wasn't too bulky, but also something that offered some protection. My first case was the Pursuit, but I felt it was too big, and the cover switch for the ringer did not work properly, so I returned it.After much research, and nearly buying a silicon case with fuzzy lining, I chose this. I went back to it because it was American made, which I felt meant it may have went through a strict quality control process, and I liked the feel of the pursuit case, despite the non-functioning ringer cover switch.I am happy with this purchase, and for the face of the phone that is not covered, I feel this product works well if you have a separate glass face protector. I am usually a bigger fan of single piece protectors, but not in the instance of a case where a touch screen is involved. I am also happy that this case was not as bulky as I expected, as I had planned to get a slimmer case for formal events. To me, this provides excellent protection without being bulky.This unit went on over my phone a little tight at first, as it was activating some of the side volume buttons as it was being fitted over my iPhone 8 Plus. But once on, it felt very snug. I like that the case feels nice with semi-grippy rubber around the side, but rigid and hard along the surfaces on the back at the same time. I guess I'm a tactile sort of person because besides liking the feel of this case in hand, I have no problems placing my phone down on hard concrete (which I would be nervous about doing with iPhones bare glass exterior) and enjoy that the phone feels protected in my front (yes, front) pocket as well, from shifting and or bending.An important feature to me is that the camera 'bump' is aligned in a fitted hole that gives it and the flash an ample opening and provides what feels to be a quarter's thickness to keep the bump from touching a surface if the case is placed camera-side down.The bottom cut-outs for the lightning cable and bottom speakers holes seem perfectly aligned for me, and the side buttons for the power and the volume controls are pleasantly stiff, which are find for me since I do not use them much and value the protection they provide for the little-used buttons. I also like that the ringer on/off switch is a simple cut-out rather than an attempted addition side button. I feel that this switch is, by design, something to correctly cover and have another working switch over it, as the Pursuit attempted to do.I highly recommend this case and I think it is an excellent value on Amazon at $28 at the time of purchase. I would be willing to bet it's nearly twice as much if you buy it at your local cell phone provider.Thank you for reading and I hope this review helps you.",
            "This is the fake GARBAGE that AMAZON Fullfilment sent to me! It\u2019s a FAKE KNOCK OFF of an Otterbox branded Symmetry Series case. Amazon\u2019s is made in China. The REAL Symmetry case from Otterbox is much different looking and comes in very expensive packaging!!! Total disappointment from Amazon today!!!",
            "The item I received is NOT a true Otterbox. The box that this cheap silicone/ rubber cover came in states \u201cStylish Coice, Fashion Case\u201d with an Otterbox sticker stuck crookedly on front. The \u201ccase\u201d does not have a hard back or a raised beveled edge. I know this is fake since I\u2019ve had one for my previous iPhone and it was a wonderful product. Otterbox box was also imprinted in the case. This \u201ccover\u201d does not have Otterbox on it anywhere. Returning immediately.** Added pics. I purchased a real one from Best Buy on left. They price matched Amazon. You can see the flimsy fake in second pic and the true Otterbox in last two pics.",
            "I've had this case for almost 10 months so I think I can speak definitively about this.Look I know I'm the kind of person who drops stuff. I'm also the kind of person who likes to go out which makes me a 2x kind of person who drops stuff. So when I'm getting a case, it's a short term relationship.Not this son of a gun. Let me tell you the ways I've dropped this - off of a desk, off a ladder, accidentally threw across the street, sneezed so hard it flew out of my hands and hit the wall, angrily made hand movement and it slipped out, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on a couch, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on the floor,  dropped in a pot of water (that probably has more to do with the phones water resistance but STILL), thrown as a joke, thrown as not a joke, adamant gesticulation, demonstrating how hard my brother's head was by hitting him with it (would not recommend), trying to impress girlfriend, dropped every day.Seriously, as someone who drops their phone both intentionally and unintentionally, I cannot recommend this case enough. Also it looks good, I love the color, it's light and is the slimmest case that will still protect your phone to a degree that you legitimately don't have to worry about it if you're a class A phone dropper.",
            "Case seems to protect the phone well enough but it scratches very easily and the scratches make it very slippery and hard to hold. After only having the case for a short time it already looks terrible. Not a good design, next time I\u2019ll be going with something other than OtterBox.",
            "Terrible...I always trust otter box with my phones. This case however let me down. It is really pretty but pretty poor quality. The back got scratched from just placing it on a table, and not to mention the color transfer from any clothing item you wear. I\u2019m disappointed I paid so much money for this disappointing case \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",
            "Did not protect the back of my phone from breaking.  My phone was in my coat pocket and I was bent down getting something from the floor of my car when my phone slipped out of my pocket and fell to the driveway. I didn\u2019t even cringe, it was such a small distance and didn\u2019t sound like a hard fall. Very shocked to see the cracks across the back. Ive trusted in this brand for years and was very disappointed!",
            "I give one star because I can\u2019t give a 0... In the features says STAY- CLEAR / ANTI-YELLOWING, one of the main reasons I bought it. But after a week using it it\u2019s horrible. Looks like it\u2019s 2 colors! All the edge it\u2019s yellow, looks dirty. DONT BUY IT !",
            "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It is very protective yet fashionable. She\u2019s dropped her phone multiple times from pretty high with his case on and her phone stayed safe; the case did not take any damage either. It came in the nice packaging and also came with a warranty. (The white splotches seen on the case in the photos are just from the flash.) I hope this review helps! \ud83d\ude04",
            "Ugh I had high hopes for this one, but I dropped my phone twice..and not from a skyscraper.. from less than 3 feet and both times my glass protector cracked.. thankfully I had the protector on it, but I have had the same screen protector on my phone since December ($40) and have dropped it many times without a scratch.. but since this case doesn\u2019t actually cover the phone.. the phone touches the ground first instead of the case.. and that\u2019s why it cracked it.. I went back to the other series and so far so good..Another thing ..the phone is hella slippery when your trying to use it.. no grip what so ever ..The only thing I liked was that I could use the Apple mirror in the back since it was see through"

            "I notice that many people are complaining about the number of pages the ink prints.  I too had this problem at first.  The solution was simple.  I put the settings on draft which prints the same quality with less ink.  Standard print eats a lot of ink and if you put it on best it definitely consumes ink really quick.  I keep my printer set on draft and change it to standard only when doing special printing such as t-shirts, invitations or greeting cards.  When the light comes on that means that you have at least 50 pages (sometimes more) that you can print before you run out of ink.  I was able to put the cartridges I removed (because of the low ink light) back into the printer and got 50 or more pages out of them.  Just glad I decided to try it before I threw the cartridges away.  I hope this helps.",
            "Yes, this was easy to install.  No, it wasn't worth the purchase price.  I printed out about 15 pages and all of a sudden my low ink light was back on.  Yes, the printer was inexpensive, but I have since tossed it because the cost of the ink was going to bankrupt me.  I am very disappointed because I liked the printer.  This is no deal.  Maybe if you print something every week or two, but not good for daily use.",
            "Didn't seem to last as long as I expected.  But that may be misleading, since it starts telling you your ink levels are low when the cartridge is maybe one-half consumed. The Pop-up warning screen shows the ink level to be like maybe 5%, when you still have lots of ink left.  So, don't replace the cartridge until it actually stops printing.  For me, that was at least one hundred copies later.",
            "This is the first time I ordered just the black ink (I usually get the combo) but there is no reason it should be such a poor product...they are the same thing. This printed 10 pages vs 25 with the one I got in the combo pack. I couldn't finish my project even. NEVER again!",
            "Would of gave it five stars but could only afford 4 after buying ink lol",
            "I am very dissapointed. I put this in today and after making four copies my printer says I need new ink.",
            "As with all Canon ink cartridges, runs out much too quickly. This was never a problem some years back but most definitely is now. I used to print regularly and only had to replace ink every few months but now it seems even with hardly printing anything at all, the ink runs out. It is getting to where buying a new printer is cheaper than buying ink!",
            "Lasted for about 15 sheets. Very much a scam. I thought i was imagining things, or perhaps doing something wrong with the printer settings but, after reading others\u2019 reviews, I\u2019ve concluded it\u2019s a scam. I saved 5 cartridges I have bought and used in about one year, and I hardly ever print. Waste of money, shipping and packaging. Someone should complain that this is FRAUDULENT.",
            "works well and easy to install, swapping cartridges takes 15 seconds. For some reason, the canon printers burn lots of black ink. It could be the consumption rate or the cartridge itself that requires this much ink. I don't print much so it isn't a issue.PS: Based on the supreme court decision in Lexmark v. Impression, it is fully legal and permissible for a third party to fill your ink cartridges. Not sure if there is one yet for this cartridge, but maybe worth a search? Hope that saves you some money!",
            "It just doesn't seem fair that these ink cartridges are so darn expensive. The quality of re-manufactured or other brand cartridges is just the same, but the problem is that Canon printers detect them and flash up a warning and won't work with anything of a reasonable cost. So we are stuck with buying Canon's new ones.Canon compensates by selling the printer for $34! The Canon printer is wonderful and definitely my favorite among all the many other brands I've owned. But it doesn't seem fair that the ink is so very expensive -- not much of a discount for buying in bulk, either.I'd be happier if they would do good discounts if you are buying 3 or more. Give the consumer a break."

            "I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.",
            "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.",
            "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(",
            "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.",
            "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.",
            "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.",
            "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.",
            "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad",
            "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.",
            "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"

            "Not enough people put their body dimensions on here to make sizing an unseen/unknown shirt easy.I'm a guy - so I don't care if you know my specs - here they are:6' 5\" tall310 lbs23\" technical torso measurement (back of neck to waist line)21\" armpit to waist line54\" chest18\" pythons (biceps for you skinny hipsters)Usually I buy shirts in 2 XL, 2 XLT, or 3X.Normally I buy shirts with the \"tall\" designation since my gut sticking out typically makes a \"non-tall\" shirt rise just to the point of showing skin when I lean back or reach up with my arm(s). No one wants to see that - unless that is your \"thing\"I went with the 2XLT version of this as a baseline.Results:100% cotton shrinks even if it \"preshrunk.\" Pre-shrunk does not shrink as much, but there is a noticeable shrink none the less.New from package w/ no wash - length was fine - fit was snug, but not too much to show off the moobs or gut too badly.First wash - length still fine - fit was too tight - moobs and gut sticking out like an over packed sausage - not flattering.-You can pull the shirts to stretch it out to be less form fitting, but I don't want to mess with that after every wash.Returned both 2 XLT's and went with a 3X regular length.3X reg length is good enough (unless reaching with arms up as far as I can) - fit is quite loose on the moobs and gut (read comfortable and flattering), but not to tent proportions.Shirt really is heavyweight and I love it. Can't see through it and looks like it will last a while, just like most Dickies items do!Pocket is a touch too tight/small for my Galaxy S5 with case since they seamed in a dedicated pen/pencil pouch inside the total front pocket dimensions. As is, it is good enough to hold a couple pens or something along the size of a deck of cards.Ask your grandma, mother, or wife for a seam ripper to remove the Dickies tag on the front pocket. If they are good with the stitch, ask them to rip out the dedicated pen/pencil pouch and the pocket becomes big enough for a smart phone.I used to buy Fruit of the Loom Men's Short Sleeved Pocket T-Shirt from both the Normal and Best collections since they used to be available locally in a \"mart\" store. That Wal place doesn't carry the front pocket shirt in my sizes anymore so I found them here on Amazon. FotL changed their material/construction practices with this shirt recently and they are bad quality, even at $5-$8 a pop.  They lasted me about 6 months of 1-2x/week use and one weekly washing before fabric was worn thin and piling badly.  They are now dedicated \"I don't care what happens to them work shirts\"I am a fan of Dickies items and I would say that these shirts display overall good quality and with some modifications done at home I would highly recommend them.",
            "I want to start our by saying that I am, in general, happy with both the quality of the product and the timeliness of the delivery.I used to buy Champion tee shirts ;with featured a decent weight fabric and a generous cut.  A few years back Champion was bought out by Fruit of the Loom and the fabric got lighter, and the cut got skimpy--now resembling the Fruit of the Loom tee shirts.I then switched to Dickies (regular weight) which I can buy at Walmart.  It featured an even heavier fabric and an even more generous cut than the Champion tees of old.  I am happy with the Dickies standard weight tees.  But Walmart carries them in on black, white and gray only.  I wanted colors.I ordered the Dickies heavy weight. When it arrived I tossed it in the laundry along with a brand new Dickies standard weight.  When they were laundered I handled both and they did not feel much different.  I examined the construction and they appear to be the same quality (excellent).  The heavy weight was made in Nicaragua, and the standard weight was produced in the Honduras.  But both seem of similar assembly quality.I decided to weigh them on my kitchen scale:  Stardard weight (XL) 9.25 ounces; Heavy weight (XL) 9.75 ounces a difference of 1/2 ounce (5.26%).  Hardly a heavy weight.So if you are not interested in colors, I recommend the standard weight; if you want the colors go with the heavy weight.If you want a true heavy weight tee I only know of Duluth Trading whose tees are of a true heavy weight fabric and the cut is generous but the product is expensive.  I find the Dickies to be a much better value.  For tall men, the Dickies are available in a \"tall\" too.A good product, but not really a heavy weight.",
            "The Dickies Men's Short Sleeve Heavyweight Crew Nick t-shirts are great! We ordered in 6 different colors. I know this might sound crazy but husband and I have been searching for the past 3+ years for t-shirts that would meet the following basic criteria:1. Heavy Weight Cotton2. Will survive going through the washer more than a dozen times.3. Minimal shrinkage after washing/drying4. Not See-Through -- no secondary shirt needed5. Little to no graphics6. Tag-lessThe Dickies t-shirts exceeded our expectations. The t-shirts are the thickness of the cotton that used to be the norm in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's.  Most t-shirt companies have made the cotton thinner, and thinner and thinner. To the point the men might start wearing man bra's. The Dickies t-shirts do not have obnoxious graphics added (which is also hard to find). The front pock contains a small Dickies logo. Another positive, the inside back neck is \"tag-less\".We like these t-shirts so much, that I'm tempted to order another dozen or two for upcoming years.",
            "I love these shirts. I now own around 12 in various darker colors. They are great fitting and nicely made. The material is indeed thicker than usual, yet not heavy or stifling in heat. They do have two problems, however: 1) The colors fade, and some of them do so very quickly. Gray seems to hold up best. Green and brown are losing a lot of color saturation with every single wash. 2) These things are oil STAIN MAGNETS. You may not notice anything while wearing them or doing the laundry, but later, it's not uncommon to take a \"clean\" one off the hanger and notice a few spots, then throw it right into the hamper. None of my other shirts do this, from cheap 100% cotton tees to poly blends.For both of these problems, I'm only knocking off one star because I really do love these shirts otherwise. There must be something that other manufacturers are doing to protect their fabric, but Dickies is not. For now, I'm keeping a bottle of\u00a0Grandma's Secret GS7001 Laundry Spray, 16-Ounce\u00a0near the washing machine. I've found it works fairly well. Usually.",
            "I'm 6.2 and 205 and don't like short sleeves crowding into my armpit, so I normally go up a size so that my shoulder seam drops over the side of my upper arm by an inch or so. In this case I took the suggestions about going up a size again due to these running small?So XL normally works and I like the shirt tail to be longer so I want to tuck them in and they will stay put!Based on the reviews here, I ordered the 2XLT, so when these arrive the seam between the upper part of the sleeves and the shoulder rides just over the top of my shoulder, but the sleeve are still a bit short by 3/4 to even a full inch. They had a bit better fit before washing and I don't use a dryer for most of my cloths. Anyway, I'm keeping the shirts, the collar seems to be well made and keep it's shape so that's important as well.Note: Shirts from another order were made in Pakistan and were not stated as being \"heavyweight\" shirts.they feel about the same (a bit softer maybe) and yet the fitting is better with about 1/2 in more sleeve than ones from this order, which were made Nicaragua? Laying both out seam to seam and the sleeve on the Pakistan was a bit longer than those from Nicaragua, both shirts had been washed twice!IMO - the material that is being used today vs. the past are not going to hold up as well as shirts from late 80's and early 90's which in my case held up well past 20 years or more and many were made in the USA.",
            "If  you are big AND tall, make sure Amazon sends you the correct shirt.  I've ordered several of these Dickies shirts, and about every other order, Amazon sends me 1 or more of the wrong size.  The most common mistake is they send me a \"3XL\" instead of the \"3XLT\" I ordered.  If it doesn't have the \"T\", it isn't a tall shirt!  Check every shirt you order.  I've had orders where some were correct and others were wrong.  I'veeven had two shirts of the same color in the same order where 1 will be a tall and other other won't.  Amazon customer service tells me they are sending in requests for the warehouse to check stock, but I still get the wrong shirts.  The difference between tall and regular is 2-3\" and for me makes the difference between being able to tuck the shirt in or not.Overall, I'd give the shirts 4.75 stars.  They seem to be very well constructed.  Based on how thin some other shirts I\u2019ve bought are, these could easily be considered heavy fabric.  The actual thickness of the fabric varies a bit between different colors.  I am both big and tall, so it is unheard for me to find good T's for $8-12/ea.There is a paper label around waist high which you will want to cut off, it rustles. The label on the back of the neck is printed on the shirt, so nothing to rustle or scratch there.Content: Of the shirts I have, content varies by color.100% cotton  - Chocolate, Dark Navy, Dark Olive, English Red, Heather Green, Lincoln Green, Orange, Royal Blue.99% cotton, 1% polyester - Ash Grey90% cotton, 10% polyester  - Heather GreyMade in: Nicaragua and Mexico.There is a slight variation in the cuts of the different colored shirts.  Some are a little roomier than others.  The label recommends washing in cold.  I HIGHLY recommend washing in cold.  The shirts tend to shrink a little the first couple times they are washed.I always wash mine in cold and hang them up to dry, but still had that little bit of shrinkage.  The most comfortable: Dark Navy and Black Olive.  They started out very roomy and even after a bit of shrinkage are still quite comfortable.  Chocolate and Lincoln Green just barely still fit.  Desert Sand started out ok, but after two washings it had shrunk enough that it is a little small.  I find I'm yanking on it to stretch it.Don't take the Amazon listing picture colors too seriously.  I've included a pic of the actual shirts.  Chocolate and Dark Olive appear lighter in my photo than they do in person.",
            "I've been buying these shirts for over 10 years. Work great for use as winter undershirt or summer casual. I wash in warm / regular cycle and warm / regular dry. I buy one size larger than needed because of shrinkage (3xlt shrinks to 2xlt).18.5\" neck ... 51\" chest ... 6'4\" ... 240 Lbs.Pros: (7 shirts rotated on daily basis)* Heavyweight = 6.75 oz. 100% cotton* 2 Yrs. ... Beginning signs of stretching / fraying / color fading* 3 Yrs. ... Time to replaceCons:I really can't think of any.I hope this review helps:)",
            "Possibly the best crew neck T I've owned.  Love the fit. Its comfortable, and the collar doesn't loosen after a day of working in it. There is a WORLD of difference between these and the standard Gildan/Hanes tees available at Walmart or similar stores. I'll never go back to a traditional tee after owning these heavyweight ones. It's also much better than the Pro Club brand, which was highly recommended by a couple guys I work with. I actually wear these out daily while getting groceries or doing other things because I like them so much.",
            "The Dickie's Men's short sleeve shirts are perfect for my husband! Here is a picture of him in the Orange color, which is great for his job. The shirts are heavy weight material and they hold up nicely for a long time.  He is 6'2\" and about 195 lbs. He wares size Large. They shrink just a touch on high heat in the dryer and then it's a perfect fit.",
            "I bought this shirt because of it's pocket, high rating, and low price.  I'm dissapointed.  First, if your a big guy, NFL, lumberjack, you'll probably love this shirt.  I'm 5'11, 165 lbs, career military.  This fits me nice in the shoulders and chest, but hangs like a dress around my middle, because there is NO shape or form fitting.  I could live with that.  Wouldn't be the first shirt made for larger people that I have to have tailored to fit me below the chest, but here's the real kicker.  There's something about the design of the sleeves and the weight of the fabric that causes the whole shirt to lift up and bunch around the chest and neck if I lift my arms up shoulder height or higher.  That's definitely something you don't want in a T-Shirt that is supposed to be soft and comfortable.  This cotton is pretty stiff.  Maybe after a few washes it'll be softer, but it seems like a fairly stiff weave.  It certainly doesn't hang/drape like the pictures shown.  Lastly, the pocket, as shown in the picture, wraps around the side of the chest and is largely useless except for keeping a pen in.  It does have a separate little pen spot in the pocket, but the opening is too small to use most modern pens with a rubberized grip.  So, all in all, pretty disappointing for me."

            "I'm going to start this review by clarifying that I have a lean, narrow foot. I have a C toe and a B heel. So this review is biased towards a narrow foot. That being said, I have tried about twenty different sandals to find a couple that fit reasonably snug. So for comparison purposes this may be a useful guide for people. My preferences are light weight, comfortable, with a heel strike that has some padding. I also like moderate arch support. I don't want a lot of flop in my flip. I don't want a negative heel. I'm going to list the sandals I've tried, and give a brief comparison, which should be helpful to everyone. I'll start with this one:Reef Phantom LE - (Mens 9) This leather sandal is much lighter than most of the others, weighing in at 142g. Somewhat more snug fitting than average. Very comfortable and attractive. Reasonably priced. This pair was a keeper for me.Reef Mens Leather Fanning ll - (9 Mens) These are the heaviest of all the sandals I've tried, weighing in at 219 grams each. The footbed is comfortable but more firm than some of the others. Nice looking. They have an average fit, (fairly snug), but they were a little lose on me. I think these would last a long time. Unlike with the Reef Draftsman, I did not feel the bottle opener under my arch. Comfortable, but expensive and heavy.Reef Leather Slap ll - (Mens 9) Oddly, this sandal was a full size shorter than any other Reefs I tried, (A full 1/2 inch), so order up. They weighed in at 205 grams each, making them the second heaviest in this comparison. Had they been the same size as the Fanning ll's they would have been the heaviest. Average fit. These are one of the most comfortable sandals in this line-up. Very cushy heel.Reef Phantom Prints - (9) Weighing in at 113g, these were the second lightest sandal of the bunch. Snug fitting and comfortable, these are my personal favorites. Reasonably soft heel-strike with an average width footbed and just the right amount of arch support. They won't likely last as long as some of the heavier sandals, but they can be had for half the cost. I've seen them for $20 on up, depending on color and size.Reef Phantoms - (Mens 10) These synthetic sandals seem to be made elsewhere from the other two Phantoms listed above. The fit is much different. They are wider in the footbed and sloppy fitting. These are made for a wide foot. Again, they are fairly light, weighing in at 134g, and I got these a full size up from the other two because everyone said they ran small. I think they run just a half size smaller.Reef Draftsman - (9) This is a leather sandal with no additional heel support. It also has a bottle opener on the bottom. Nice looking, fairly snug fitting, and fairly light, (About 156g) but this sandal has an issue. As others have indicated, you can feel the bottle opener under your arch. I don't think anyone would be comfortable in these for long. I sent these back.Reef Crew - (9) This leather sandal is fairly light at 138g each. They have a slender footbed and a somewhat snug fit. I like that, however, there is no additional heel support and they run as high as $60.Reef Twinpin - (9) These basic synthetic leather sandals are fairly light at 137g each, and they have a slender footbed, but the thong is very lose and has no additional heel-strike.Sanuk Fraid So - (10) These sandals weighed in at a modest 139g each and were really comfortable and attractive. I loved this sandal. Unfortunately, they have a very wide footbed and a very lose fitting thong. Yep, fraid so. But if you have fat feet, you'll love these.Sanuk M Fraid - (9) These leather/poly sandals weighed in at 175g each, making them one of the heavier sandals here. They have a slender footbed, (A full half inch thinner than the Fraid So), but with a sloppy thong.Sanuk Beer Cozy - (9) This fabric sandal has a wide footbed and a sloppy thong, but weighed in at a respectable 134g each. These have a very cushy, comfortable footbed. People rave about how comfortable they are. But you need to have fat or wide feet. Dang!Teva Mush ll - (9) These are by far the lightest of the bunch, weighing in at a mere 92g each. They're also comfortable with a fairly narrow footbed and a snug thong. So, yes, I love these. And at $25 they are a bargain, even though they won't last as long as some of the more expensive sandals here. The middle of the heel-strike is a little harder than the surrounding area and some people have complained about it, but I haven't been bothered by it in the short periods of time I've spent in them.Teva Men's Classic - (9) This is a very basic, uninspired sandal with a ruff, heavily textured, old school footbed. Perfect for some people, but I found them uncomfortable. It's light, but not as light as the Mush ll's. The thong was more loose than the Mush ll and it runs a little more money.Teva Mush ll (Canvas) (9) I listed these as well because the canvas thong fits more loosely than the regular Mush ll's and weighed a little more. Other than that they have the same footbed.",
            "Second pair of reef I bought here and they broke within 2 weeks. It's also smaller than the ones they sell in the stores. I think it's knock offs. The ones I bought at a department store still last me 4 years now",
            "Not sturdy in the least. If you're going to write a review here, I hope you've at least worn these continuously for a few weeks because mine came apart just outside of the 30 day return window.While wading through a creek, the webbing on not one but both flip flops pulled out of the sole. There are no visible tears or broken stitches, so I can only conclude that it was held in the sole by glue that gave out when I tried to lift my foot out of the water. That's just cheap manufacturing. With a little more material, the webbing could've all been sewn together and there would be no risk of it pulling out, but instead the manufacturer went with cheap glue instead.You would expect \"Reef\" flip flops would be able to survive a little water, but you would be wrong.",
            "So to start off I wore the Reef sandals with the bottle openers on the bottom for a year and I loved them, and they were correctly sized. I got a size ten of these phantom sandals and it was way to small, but I went ahead and returned for an 11, they were also too small and different from the first pair, like different materials used in the strap.Finally ordered a 12 and they actually fit (my size ten feet) but the under part of the straps are cratchy and uncomfortable, and I have medium high arches but the arch bump on these is huge, I was worried i\u2019d roll my ankle again because they made both my feet tilt outward. And they just look ugly, these fit as in my feet will go in them but the back is almost level with my heel while the front sticks out like 2 inches past my toes, pic included of the size 12s",
            "Bought mine 02/17/17. Fell apart 06/02/17. Horrible previously had a pair that lasted 10 years.",
            "okay, the sandals fit, but the strap is WAY tight. I can tell they will break in eventually, and I'll probably wear them in the shower a couple times to help, but wow... they are tight. the first time I tried them on, I was ready to send them back. But I knew if I went a size up, the sandal would be too big and then of course there is a possibility of the strap also being too loose and loosening even more once broken in. So, I figured I would wear them for a day and just wiggle my toes often to keep my feet from falling off. So far so good. I have not lost any toes. They are great sandals, and I got mind for $25, but I would not pay any more than that. I guess if you are reading this, I would recommend trying a size up, especially if you are a half size like I am. I ended up going with a 10 instead of an 11. After a couple days they will be fine, but if you don't want the hassle of breaking them in like I have to, go a size up.",
            "I bought this for my husband and years of wearing out his old Reefs and I LOVE IT!  Yes, me, a woman. Even though I bought it for my husband, I use it every chance I can get to run out and get the mail from the mailbox, or to get something either from the yard or garage.  It is so comfortable. I have dry heels and even wearing these sandals makes it feel comfy. They're not hard or rough like other sandals I've worn, they have the perfect amount of  cushion.  My husband love his sandals too.  After wearing out his old one after years of wearing them, he asked me to find him another pair of Reef sandals!  He rarely asks me to buy the same brand of shoes or sandals AND believe it or not, he's really picky, that's how awesome these sandals are!  He like Reef as much as his Sanuk, if not more. I would definitely recommend these to others who wants a pair of durable comfy sandal.  I'll buy myself a pair once I find myself one at an awesome price like this pair.",
            "I love and have loved Reefs for years......  Capitalism is a weird thing.  These sandals used to be made with RUBBER soles that lasted for MANY MANY YEARS.  When my last pair broke (4+ years of use), I started looking for a replacement.  I was shocked that I had to spend so much time finding a pair of plain old reefs without bottle openers on the sole (gross) for under thirty dollas.  I thought I hit the jackpot when I found these on Amazon.  Much to my surprise, when I started wearing them, I noticed they were manufactured with some hard plastic crap sole that is akin to the garbage found on the bottom of most sneakers these days. Ever look at Nike shoes then and now? See what I mean?  Thank you capitalism for screwing consumers twice over in the name of your shareholders.  I have no problem paying more for quality products, but nowhere in the description does it state the material used for the soles, so I feel like i got hustled and I don't want others to make the same mistake.  After less than a month of wearing them, the proverbial \"tread\" has worn down to nothing.  Hear that?  It's the sound of my money flushing down the toilet to line the pockets of Reef's parent company shareholders.  bring back the rubber dammit!",
            "The straps on both pulled out within 6 weeks. The first one was in the first two weeks but I didn't think too much about it and glued it back in place with some 5 minute epoxy. The second one pulled out today while I was squatting down to pick something up. I work M-F so this was with mainly weekend and some evening use only.  Highly disappointed in the quality. As a Floridian, I've owned several pairs of Reefs in the past and they just don't make them like they used to.",
            "I have been wear flip flops all my life. I've worn Quicksilver, Tevas, Sanuk, Crocs and dirt cheap flip flops. I wear flip flops everywhere that its now sad. The Reefs Phantoms I or II have always been my favorite. Tevas would be my second choose. I don't like Crocs style and Sanuk are not bad, I just did care for them all that well. Quicksilver was narrow, soles worn out to fast and slipped a lot until finally broke. I now buy reef flip flops exclusively every year regardless if there still good. The one short coming with these flip flops is the straps are tight at first. Its always been like this for me and reefs. I have to use two hands to put them on again at first. I've worn these reefs the last 4 weeks straight and it took about 5 days to loosen up. Now that they are worn in a tad, there perfect again. I have a hard time with finding flip flops or shoes because of wide EE size 13 foot. These are wide enough and fit great. They track well with the heel as well.I don't want to give a 4 star because of the tight strap because, I believe its needed to wear in so they don't feel sloppy as they wear,  like all the over flip flop companies do. Reefs for Life!!!!"

            "The quality and fit if the shirt it's self is great. However the screen print was crooked. Enough that I noticed as soon as I opened the package. The saturation of the screen print ink was perfect and aside from the cockeyed graphic (maybe it was just a fluke?) I was very happy with this product. If print was straight, I would have rated 5 stars. I submitted photos and I put a a straight edge of a white piece of paper that was lined up with the bottom of the shirt to demonstrate the angle of the screen printing.",
            "This shirt is so cute and hilarious. I got it for my husband who loves mob movies and is a new grandfather. The print is perfect\u2014just as advertised but I have a major issue with the fit of the short. I ordered an XL as that\u2019s what he wears. The shirt is wide enough but is way to short. It\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve never seen an XL this short. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the case with all their shirts or not.",
            "Bought this for my father when I found out I was pregnant it was his gift for his birthday. It has become his favorite shirt wears it proud when we go out with the babies. The material is nice and thick and the color was black not faded not an odd shade of black just perfect.",

            "Updated!!  He is a big fan of the movie and loves it as is!!  It's a pretty shirt and the black cotton fabric seems nice and soft.  However the white printing is very light.  Due to the uneven print, it looks like if it is washed more than a couple times the printing will crack.",

He initially thought it was just a godfather T-shirt which he was excited about but when he opened the package you could see his heart melting when he saw the grandfather. Great buy!!T-shirt is well made and the text is well constructed onto shirt I had no problems with my order",
            "My husband is a huge fan of the movie, The Godfather. So as a grandfather, this was the perfect gift. The fit was exactly as expected. I might have gone one size larger in case of shrinkage.  However, he loved it.",

            "HALLELUJAH!I have been searching for years for a form fitting plain t-shirt, and I think I've found it. I have read hundreds of reviews where no one bothers putting their measurements, which I find absolutely useless for anyone else, so hopefully my review helps some of you. I was skeptical at first, just like every other time I've purchased a cheap t-shirt online (too short, too slim, too blocky, too wide, uncomfortable material), but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shirt on.I am 6'4\", 215-225 lbs and fit, so length and slimness is important to me. I bought an XL, and the length is incredible (if maybe not slightly long for some, but probably perfect after a wash). Not too often you get an XL with a cheap shirt and they keep it slim fitting rather than extending the width 15 inches assuming you're only going up a size because you're 300lbs. It fits the shoulders great. The XL extends to the ends of my shoulders ALMOST perfectly (sorry, don't have exact measurements to help here). As for the sleeves, another bonus! We all have hatred for flared sleeves and they feel like they're inevitable in cheap t-shirts. I have around 15\" cold biceps for reference and they hug the biceps all the way through without being too tight. They extend not too far past the halfway point in the bicep which I prefer (picture is accurate). Lastly, the material is very comfortable. The pictures were a bit deceiving when I was trying to guess how the material would feel but I can say my expectations were surpassed.Hopefully this helps out fellow brothers my size. I know this is the type of review I would try to scour for before purchasing, but with little success.",
            "****************IT'S BEEN A YEAR!**I've been blessed to basically live in these shirts for over a year now. I've never had a relationship like this with a t shirt... i now know for sure that it is love. My baby is 15 months old and I've managed to lose 15 lbs, so the shirts were getting a little loose. I'm cheap. And I'm resourceful. I took in an inch on the sides of these suckers and they're as good as new(ish).*****************My husband fell in love with this brand after he wore one from a local gym. He took note of the brand and then started searching the internet for it. Luckily he found it on Amazon. He knew to go up a size so it would fit better. He bought one, and then two more. And then three more. They are really soft and are a good fit (remember to go up a size).Another thing he really likes about it is that they are long enough (but not crazy long) to cover his concealed carry when he carries on his belt. He also likes the sleeve length, because as he proudly puts it, \"they show off my biceps\"This is a little embarrassing, but I started liking his shirts... so I made him buy me one. And now I think I have four. No, I have five. They are just really comfortable. It's not like I'm dressing up for my toddlers, so I wear them all the time. And to Wal-Mart. Because they're actually one of the nicest plain t-shirts I've ever worn. Comfortable enough to wear to bed as well. And, yeah, I'll just say it, not all t-shirts are great for breastfeeding with, but these are great. They aren't stiff; they have enough give, but also keep their shape.These are our favorite t-shirts and we'll probably keep ordering them and end up wearing them as senior citizens, and possibly request to be buried in them because, hey, they're really comfortable.",
            "The perfect fit, the perfect fabric, the perfect selection. We got them in every color and we don't regret it. If you've got a long torso and a particular need for softness, this is the shirt for you. The neon green/yellow is great for public events with a crowd.",
            "I'm 5'7\", have a muscular build, weigh about 168lbs. This shirt is very soft and it didn't overtly shrink in the wash/dryer. It's a great fit. I plan to buy more now that I know the cut is nice. The sleeves aren't too long and there's plenty of room in the chest and lat areas so you don't feel constricted but it's still form fitting. Awesome shirts.",
            "As other reviewers mentioned, absolutely wonderful t-shirts.  No logos, no BS, super comfy, stylish.  I'm 6'2, 270lbs, I work out but not crazy.  I bought the 3XL size.  I bought one, got it, tried it on, and went back immediately and bought 10 more in different colors.I wear them all the time, casual with jeans, dress up with slacks, although I find their colors don't really suit active wear.  I mean, they are comfortable but look a bit out of place for active wear.  Maybe because they are just plain shirts, no logos or anything, and active wear I guess is suppose to be moving billboards...but yes, I wear them at the gym because I really don't care and they are just so super soft comfy.",
            "I bought seven of these in different colors.  They are really soft and fit very well.  I bought the XL for my 42 inch chest and they fit nicely. My only complaint if you can call it that is that the colors could be more vibrant.  Don't misunderstand they are quite similar to the colors shown but could be as I said more vivid.  Very good value for the money.  The seams are well stitched with double rows, the sleeves come down about three quarters of the way down my bicep and don't ride up.  I'm reviewing all seven that I purchased in this one review.",
            "One of the best fitting t-shirts ever worn, this is without a wash, hopefully it doesn't shrink. I'm 5'11\", 175 lbs and a large fits well, but maybe just a tad too long. The sleeve length and tightness is spot on and the body section tapers down toward the waist. If you like the original plain volcom t-shirts you'll probably also like this fit and material, they are both about the same weight only $10 cheaper. If you have a thin triangular torso shape, and have a hard time finding shirts to fit because most U.S. shirts are designed to fit people over weight, then this shirt is for you. Not too tight, not too loose, just about perfect.",
            "I am confused by the abundance of reviewers stating this shirt is \"dress like\" in length. It is a great fit in my opinion, perfect.  I am thinking maybe those who are saying it is too long or guys that are really short.  I am 6'1, 180 and the M is very well fitted on me. The length sits on the upper half of my glutes and when I raise my arms in the air, it sits perfectly at the waist line without exposing skin.  I think these fit the more brodly shaped should guy.  The arm sleeve seam sits in perfect position and the sleeve splits my bicep perfectly in two allowing the meat of the tri and bi to show.  I will be purchasing more colors.  Def a nice shirt for CC",
            "For reference: 37\" chest, 6'0\" tall, 30\" waist, 145lbIf you have similar dimensions then your long search for a decent fitting shirt is over. Plus, these are way more comfortable than 100% cotton and air dry much faster. This shirt now make up 80% of the shirts in my closet. Can't believe these beautiful things are only $5.Make sure to double check each shirt when you get them. One of my shirts was ripped along the neck-line, but could be hand-sow back on. Another, clearly defective, shirt had extremely wide armholes. That one will just be used in future craft projects.Other reviewers have pointed out that white is abnormally light and allows more light to pass through than the other shirts. They are correct. Nonetheless, it has been solid enough for my preferences. Not sure how much that would change after a run through a heated dryer.",
            "I'm 49, 5'11\", 168lbs, with a medium/muscular \"fit\" build, and wear the Large.  These fit me perfectly, snug in the chest &amp; sleeves (hugs the arm with no flaring) and yet long enough to go below the belt-line, right at about the zipper on my jeans.  If you've got a belly on you, or you work out so much you look like a body-builder go a size up.  Fabric is wonderfully soft and stretchy, and washes well with only light shrinkage.  Colors hold well.  I purchased 7 of these and wear them every day as my go-to shirts."

I think a ruler or something could have been used... or when they put the shirts under the press that puts on the design, ensure that the shirt is straight.",

            "\u00a0I purchased this case for an iPhone 8 Plus. The first case Amazon sent lifts in the center causing a gap between the screen and the phone. I called OtterBox and filed a complaint. They said exchange the case with Amazon cause it's been less than 30 days. Amazon quickly sent me a second case. The second case had the exact same problem suggesting the new iPhone 8 Plus Defender Case may have quality control problems. Take a look at the photo I included with this review. The point where the plastic is connected to the case is lower on the bottom and the top then it is in the middle. The video shows the same anomaly - pressing on the screen causes the case to bend resulting in missed keypresses and harder contact. I am a huge fan of OtterBox Defender cases and my previous iPhone 6 case does NOT have this defect.UPDATED 9/26/17 - Per OtterBox's response to my review, I called Customer Service for a replacement case. A representative named Ariel took my call, looked up my incident number, and offered to help. I explained the issue with the case and OtterBox's response to my review. Ariel apologized for the defect and placed me on hold to speak with a Supervisor. Upon return, Ariel offered to complete a Warranty exchange for a new case to be sent out. I said that sounds good until Ariel asked me to pay $4.99 for Shipping and Handling. I said, let me get this straight, I ordered a new case through Amazon and it arrived defective. I replaced the case through Amazon and the second one is also defective. OtterBox invited me to call Customer Service for a replacement case and now I need to pay an additional $4.99 to have a working case sent to me by OtterBox. Clearly, OtterBox has given up on Quality Control AND on Customer Service.DO NOT BUY THIS CASE UNTIL OTTERBOX PROVIDES A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE!!!!UPDATED 10/5/17 - The replacement case finally arrived via FedEx SmartPost. The screen protector is perfectly attached to the side of the shell and there doesn't appear to be any gap between the screen and the phone. This suggests the first release of iPhone 8+ cases likely had a manufacturing defect which was corrected in stock sent to OtterBox. Check your case for screen protector alignment issues before the Amazon return policy expires and if you do need to go through OtterBox for a warranty exchange, expect to pay for shipping and handling.",
            "If you want ultimate protection, this is the case for you. But if want a case to show how slim your new iPhone is, look elsewhere. To give you an idea on the thickness, on the back around the Apple logo and camera is about a quarter inch of protection. Again, great case, small hands beware.",
            "I\u2019ve used OtterBox in the past and sometimes felt it was beyond the protection I needed.  The cases have always been made sturdy, easy to put together, and built to last.  The OtterBox remains one of the leading brands for phone case protection and I feel the brand continues to improve the case design that aligns with phone innovations.Usually, I don\u2019t gravitate towards colorful cases but the rosemarine/plum haze color is fun and not overbearing.  I also enjoy the color combination with my rose gold iPhone 7 Plus and feel that it compliments it.  The case comes in 3 pieces and is easy to put together.  The inner layer consists of two hard plastic pieces that snap around the case, one side includes the screen protector.  The outer shell is a rubbery flexible material that covers the area where the inner pieces connect and add extra protection.I\u2019m very impressed with the screen protection with this Otterbox.  In my opinion, the screen protector feels better than using the solo film screen protectors.  Not better than glass, but I have the luck of breaking glass ones after a couple of days.  The screen protector also doesn\u2019t have the annoying bubbles and doesn\u2019t cling to a speck of dust.  The only parts of the phone that are consistently exposed are the speakers and the cameras.  The buttons are covered and are fully functional without difficulty.  The lightning port and the switch to set your iPhone 7 Plus to silent are covered with the rubber but you can open them.The only downfall I used to have with the Otterbox was the size.  Now that the iPhone 7 Plus is much slimmer I feel the case is a better fit.  I can\u2019t use the Otterbox with my lightning dock but not many cases on my phone allow me to use it anyway.Overall, the Otterbox Defender for the iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent choice for people with an active lifestyle or professions that put your phone at risk for damage.  The Otterbox is one of those cases that if I were to drop my phone I wouldn\u2019t gasp and cringe in fear because I know it\u2019s thoroughly protected.",
            "I had just bought a new iPhone 7 Plus and I wanted a good case for protective purposes. In the past there had always been occasions when somehow, no matter how careful I was, I managed to drop my cellular phones. In addition, not only did I drop it, but I somehow always managed to drop it onto either a concrete or asphalt surface. At least 2 cell phones I had broken that way, so I was looking for a case that featured \"protection\" as the primary functionality feature of the case I bought. This time, I decided I was not going to make the same mistake again. Thus, I did a search for highly protective iPhone 7 plus compatible cases.Amazon has a huge collection of cases, even ones that are protective. Some even use special military grade plastics. Yet I wanted one that would allow easy access to all the features of my cell phone. This one achieves those objectives, without creating any barriers to access of all my new phone's features. Thus, I chose this one which did everything on my list of requirements.The best results and comments I can make about this \"Otterbox Defender Series Case\" is the following:  1). Installation is trivial and simple  2). Access to every feature and button is easy  3)  AND, the case is very PROTECTIVE!!!How do I know? Because within 48 hours of my installation I was getting out of my car, when I dropped it on the cement parking lot. So, I said to myself, \"Well, that is why I bought this one, so let's see if it is still working.And, Voila, every single function and button still worked. Nothing was damaged, and it greeted me immediately with perfect functionality! In addition, since that time I have dropped the phone 3 more times. Once on my hardwood floor, once on my asphalt parking lot driveway and once again on the concrete slab of my garage and every time it worked perfectly.Note please that all the drops were from an altitude of approximately waist high, therefore about 3 to 4 feet from impact. I decided that in every respect, this Otterbox Defender Series case was a perfect selection for meeting all my criteria. However, I would not attempt to find the limits of its protection. Thus, I do not recommend high altitude drops or throwing the phone and case to the concrete, but for normal use, including accidental drops this product fits the bill in every respect (I did not test for water) and thus I was totally satisfied and gave this product a well earned 5 Star rating. If good accidental drop protection is what you need, then I strongly recommend this product!",
            "The case goes on and comes off easy, dropped more than once on pavement(butterfingers) phone protected. Only two things I dont like about it are the plastic screen protector that it comes with already attached, terrible, zero protection from anything but dust, Last couple of these for other phones I just took the plastic off and the glue that attaches it and got the glass screen protector that I know offers real protection from minor impacts. The second thing is not a big deal but I figured  I\u2019d mention it, the case does increase the size of the already big phone slightly, the otterbox commuter case is thinner but I like the all rubber exterior of this one over the mostly hard plastic case of the commuter whch I also owned, the all rubber just makes the grip much more secure in your hand. Both cases offer superior protection in my opinion.",
            "What the hell is the point of getting a NEW defender case when it comes completely smeared?! This will be the second one I\u2019ve purchased the first one was fine this one looks like it fell out at the warehouse and dirty fingerprints are all over it.",
            "UPDATE- Very disappointed in otter box quality of this case. I may have received a weak and defective product. The white plastic part of the case has snapped inside the soft cover. People use these cases on construction sites with no problems. I go to school, work, and home. There should be no reason why my case has broken after 2 months of me having it. The rest of the case is in perfect condidtion. Also another downside to this open part at the top of the phone is I have to open the case to clean lint and debris from the screen every couple of weeks. That whole also lets water through so if I forget to flip the phone over while I\u2019m at the sink I have to clean water out of the case(which is how I found this break)Very pretty medium dark teal with white shell looks great on my black phone. Fit is sleek at a little under a dimes width for thickness. Durability fantastic obviously otter box is know for being one of the best for protection. The dad clip I\u2019ll admit I use. It helps my small hands hold onto this huge phone kind of like a popsocket would. The clip is also the perfect size to fit in my car door cup holder so I can use my phone for gps. Case does not obstruct the sound quality. Dislikes- although the screen protector does protect my screen from scratches it doesn\u2019t not stop debris from getting in the case. I did not want to have a built in screen protector. I wanted tempered glass but every case with this level of fall protection has a built in protector. I also don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t have the apple logo centered in the circle in the back.I am afraid that this rubber part will start to warp and loosen. Will update with progress of that aspect.",
            "I have been a otter box fan/ user since they came out, all my cells have had them. I just upgraded my phone and i got my case in the mail. I have never experienced almost having to slam my finger down on my screen to be able to text or unlock it. the screen cover has made it almost impossible to use my phone without slamming the screen. I am so disappointed right now with this case.",
            "This is a great case, but you have to remove the built-in screen protector. The gap between the protector and your phone\u2019s glass is insane \u2014 you have to press so much harder just to initiate a tap on your phone. AND it\u2019s loud! It sounds like you\u2019re tap dancing when you text someone.Solution: Remove the built-in protector. Grab a knife and start cutting it out, get rid of it, and apply one of those adhesive high-impact glass screen protectors before you put the case on. Much better."

            "I am a woman that usually takes an 8 to an 8.5 sized shoe. I read mixed reviews, some saying these fit as expected while others said they were a little small. I looked up the Nike Men's shoe size chart and measured my feet. I saw that a 6.5 would fit perfectly. Based on reviews and my experience with Nike products (typically are made half a size smaller than my normal size) I decided to order a size 7. That way, if the sandal was a little small for my \"expected\" size, a size 7 should fit just fine. When I tried these on, I was right. The size 7 was a perfect fit!The straps have nice padding in them and the bottoms of the sandals themselves are very comfortable. You can tell they are made nicely and should last quite a few summers!On bear feet I have a good half an inch of room left at the tops with maybe a quarter of an inch of space on the backs of my feet. The sandals also fit well with regular socks and thick socks.I highly reccomend! I think for the price they are a good value. They will last you a while. I just would highly suggest basing your size off of your history with Nike products as I do find their shoes are made a little smaller than other companies.Also remember, if you are female, order 1.5 to 2 inches smaller than your regular shoe size. I usually wear a size 8.5 and since my size 8 Nikes  fit well but are snug, I decided on a size 7.Hope this helps!",
            "Though these sandals are for men, I'm a female &amp; I purchased these for myself. I normally wear sizes 8-9 (sometimes 10).These sandals are thin &amp; narrow. They run small &amp; the strap feels snug. I tried sizes 8, 9, &amp; 10. Size 10 was the only size that fit comfortably with &amp; without socks, while 8 was way too small; &amp; 9 only fit well without socks.They came in perfect conditions, &amp; are well constructed. The strap is padded which makes it comfortable to wear. The sole is hard, but not uncomfortable to walk in. The Nike logo is a glossy finish. &amp; if the white ever gets discolored or dirty, using clorox or baking soda with a toothbrush will clean it right up.Overall, I like these sandals &amp; so does my mom (whom I gave the size 8 to. &amp; I returned the 9).",
            "Bought those 6 weeks ago and the synthetic leather strap separated already. Looks like sewed on, but is cheap made in China glue. $25 down the drain",
            "Ordered the black/red but received ones with a maroonish/brown sole and orangish letters... Disappointed since it did not match the product description and images, as advertised.",
            "The strap fit for the first day. Then it stretched. That probably would have killed a couple stars, but what really does it for me is the molded base. It's too firm to mold to my foot and too flat. I don't have high arches, but in normal use, the heel slides to the inside of my foot, and I end up walking on the outside of it. Because the strap is loose, I have to constantly kick the toe of the slide up, and in a week, they're already showing signs of a lot of wear. I've worn them maybe a dozen times, probably 12 hours in total.",
            "Very good quality sandals, that's clear. One of the best ones in terms of durability and finishing. That said, on bigger sizes like 12, it becomes too narrow on the width, I had to try to stretch it out which will compromise the structure in order to use this regularly. My friend have the same one size 9 and I got size 12 and I can see that both of them have exact the same width.But still, very good sandals!",
            "They came faster than expected and fit really snug. I got a size bigger (7) but I'm sure the (6) would have fit perfectly fine.",
            "I had been wearing the adidas slides that have the elevated bumps for massaging your feet for a few years now and figured I should get a pair of slides without the pricks on it and came across these on amazon! I'm a size 9 in women's (which i believe is a size 7 in mens) but I've read the other reviews saying you should size up to wear comfortably so I ordered a size 8 and it fits very nicely! Not tight at all even with socks on :) I thoroughly enjoy these shoes and have been wearing them for almost a month now! Initially they did feel tight and it surprised me but they do kind of stretch a bit over time, nothing too crazy, just to a comfy amount. Love em !",
            "My husband owned an old pair that he purchased from a sporting store. After 2+ years of use they literally split in half (the funniest thing I've ever seen), but he was refusing to let them go. He duct taped them everyday \ud83d\ude02. I finally thought to myself, if hes not going to buy himself a new pair then I will! I was surprised to see them come in an actual nike box. I was so excited to gift him these since they were well needed \ud83d\ude02. Great quality as well. Excellent experience.",
            "Did not get what was pictured on my order however it did say black/white... but they just don't fit I got them for my son which we pretty much have the same size foot. he was complaining about them being too small so I tried them on and they are so tight and uncomfortable bc of the size issue everyone else is complaining about. I can see that they may be a good shoe but the sizing is all wrong and I'm disappointed with the fact that the image I purchase doesn't at all match the show I received."

            "I was originally hesitant to buy these shorts because the model looked a bit dorky (maybe it was just the shorts and the shirt tucked in... I just felt that vibe) and the price was super low. Don't let that keep you from buying these shorts! They are not only exceedingly well made but they are the perfect length (above the knee). At a price of 15 dollars you won't find any other shorts that come close to these. I really love how Amazon has democratized good looking clothing!",
            "I've got a pair of dockers that are a 36 inch waist.  I've put on a little weight but the 36in waist still fits, just a bit snug.  Given that, I thought I'd order a 38 in these shorts and they'd be a nice solid fit.  Instead, they are nowhere near buttoning.  Basically, a 36 in a Dockers is the same as a 32 in Amazon.  How is it possible that they are so bad at measuring?  In any case, order at least 1-2 sizes above what you need on these horrible shorts.",

            "The shorts are excellent quality for the price, they fit right above my knees which is exactly as the picture. I'm 5'9 175 size 32 and it fits just perfect, the only drawback is the color of the khaki is not strong but at 15 dollars, i cant complain.",
            "I've got name brand shorts with a whale logo that cost six times as much as these. Honestly, I'm not sure I could tell the difference if I could figure out a way to construct a \"blind\" test. The Amazon Essential shorts look and feel great. The fabric is a nice medium weight with a soft feel. Overall, I am very satisfied!",
            "Incredibly poor quality.  The button of these shorts came off the first time I wore them (they were not tight) while I was walking around a crowded city. Was very embarrassing and I expect more from Amazon.  You really get what you pay for with these shorts",
            "Good quality for the price. I found them to be a little longer than I expected. I think that's because I'm used to shorts that sit lower. These are right at my true waist and then some, leading to a bit of extra length through the seat and crotch. I just rolled the ends of the shorts up once and now they look more stylish and fit pretty much as I expected. If they could do anything I'd ask for a 28\" waist version. That would probably be spot on for me."

            "Highly recommend this product, purchased this for my wife 2 weeks ago along with the iPhone X. Also had a tempered glass screen protector on it...anyways, I dropped her off at the front door of the house today and after she closed the door she accidentally dropped the phone and it of course landed under the back tire of the car. Unknowingly I proceeded to drive to park and run over it! Thankfully it was perfectly fine! The screen protector however didn\u2019t get so lucky. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the performance of this case! Recommend to everyone! -Rebeca\u2019s husband",
            "Doesn't fit properly on my iPhone Xs. The rubber buckles around the buttons. It is real loose the volume and on and off button. This case does not fit properly, the edges are exposed and flimsy. I\u2019d be worried if I drop it. This is not for iPhone Xs. I am hugely disappointed. Openings at the bottom for mike is bigger than required (looks like they sent the cover for iPhone Xs). Camera and apple logo on the back of the phone do not properly fit at the center of the openings.  This is a huge disappointment since its a costly cover then it should fit in the iPhone Xs.",
            "This case is great! Sleek but feels protective. It has a \"lip\" that goes over the phone screen so if you drop it, the case hits the ground first and not the screen. I had no issues with it not fitting as previous reviewers mentioned, this one fits perfectly over the X with no bulges or button alignment issues.I've used the Commuter Otterbox for every previous iPhone I owned and they were always great, so I hope this one continues to work just as well!",
            "I bought this case because I had the same one for my iPhone 6s and it worked with a new baby so well. My baby would throw it and drop it all the time and nothing ever happened. For years I didn\u2019t have one crack.  I got the new iphone XS two weeks ago and just a few days into using this case the screen is cracked. You can tell that this case isn\u2019t as good as the older version of the same model because it doesn\u2019t come up as high around the sides of the screen so it can\u2019t provide as much protection. I\u2019m not sure why otter box changed their design for the commuter but I am returning this and paying to get my screen fixed :(((((",
            "Pros\u2022 Slim but provides the perfect protection to your iPhone X.\u2022 Two layers case.\u2022 Hole in the back for the ones who like to show off the Apple logo.\u2022 Feels good in your hands with a great grip.\u2022 Even if your phone has a tempered glass, thanks to its raised beveled edge, it will keep the screen safe if the phone fell on a flat surface.\u2022 Provides great protection to your back camera thanks to the raised beveled edge.\u2022 The buttons are very responsive.\u2022 Protects your lighting port against dust and debris, thanks to a nice cap.\u2022 Wireless charger friendly, I am using a Choetech.Cons\u2022 Might slip on some hard surface.",
            "Overview: This case has protected my iPhone X from numerous drops.Pros:  I'm not an overtly clumsy person.  But for some reason I feel like I need to drop my $1,000 phone onto the ground from waist to chest height.  Not a single scratch has appeared from the numerous drops.Cons:  The reason I keep dropping my phone is the hard outer shell is super slick.  Imagine dipping your hands into olive oil and then picking up your phone.  That is how slick this case is.  There is no texture to the outer shell.  You will accidentally drop your phone with this case...numerous times.  The good news is, it is awesome at protecting the phone from the inevitable drops.",
            "I do not believe this is a legit Otterbox, or the quality of Otterbox has changed. With all my previous Otterbox cases the two part system has worked really well and both layers feel of quality. This case has a cheap rubber that is not flexible as they have been before and and doesn\u2019t fit like a glove. The plastic is lacking the support to keep the rubber tightly against the phone especially on the top half of the phone.",
            "I bought the symmetry case clear and it was scratched up in a week. This case has more protection and is just as slim! Weighs more yes, but it\u2019s worth it. 1,000 dollar phone deserves this case. Don\u2019t be cheap!  Plus you get the opening in the back for the Apple LogoWorks with WIRELESS CHARGING TOO",
            "I got this for my new iPhone Xs as I loved the Commuter case on my previous iPhone 7.  Overall I did not feel like this case fit the phone well. Not sure if this is an issue with the Xs or just the overall design of the case.  The rubber portion felt loose and spongy, especially around the side button and camera while the outer plastic piece felt like it was too small and never felt completely secure over the rubber.  Things just didn't line up or look tidy.I just ordered and received the Otterbox Symmetry Case which feels perfect on my phone.  Seems like a much more secure fit and doesn't seem to sacrifice anything on protection.  Love Otterbox and their products, but the Commuter on the iPhone Xs is a \"miss\" for me",
            "I was really excited to get this case but disappointed when I got it. I have always had a Defender case and this doesn\u2019t feel as safe as I\u2019m used to. There is only rubber on the inside and slightly on the edges so I doesn\u2019t grip that well when holding or using on the side. Also there is no clear protector for the circle in the back which is what made me decide to return it. Great case for someone who is careful with their phone just not someone who wants to feel protected."

            "Say you were at a high school football game. Say you were sitting on the top of the bleachers. Say some old lady kicked your purse and your phone was on top. Say your phone skated in slo-mo into the gap in between the seats and walkway. Say you watched it careen the 15 feet or so to the ground below, into the dirt, under the bleachers. Say you looked at her and you knew she knew and she didn\u2019t even say sorry. Say you found a custodial guy eating a burger with a *LOT* of mustard. Say you complimented him on his hunk of keys and told him the tale. Say he unlocked a creepy gate under the bleachers and found your phone in THIS OTTERBOX and it was perfectly fine. This is what happened to me. Wish it were cuter? Say you put on a jungle PopSocket with pink flamingoes. I will NEVER get another case. Only me and the OTTERBOX.",
            "\u00a0I purchased this case for an iPhone 8 Plus. The first case Amazon sent lifts in the center causing a gap between the screen and the phone. I called OtterBox and filed a complaint. They said exchange the case with Amazon cause it's been less than 30 days. Amazon quickly sent me a second case. The second case had the exact same problem suggesting the new iPhone 8 Plus Defender Case may have quality control problems. Take a look at the photo I included with this review. The point where the plastic is connected to the case is lower on the bottom and the top then it is in the middle. The video shows the same anomaly - pressing on the screen causes the case to bend resulting in missed keypresses and harder contact. I am a huge fan of OtterBox Defender cases and my previous iPhone 6 case does NOT have this defect.UPDATED 9/26/17 - Per OtterBox's response to my review, I called Customer Service for a replacement case. A representative named Ariel took my call, looked up my incident number, and offered to help. I explained the issue with the case and OtterBox's response to my review. Ariel apologized for the defect and placed me on hold to speak with a Supervisor. Upon return, Ariel offered to complete a Warranty exchange for a new case to be sent out. I said that sounds good until Ariel asked me to pay $4.99 for Shipping and Handling. I said, let me get this straight, I ordered a new case through Amazon and it arrived defective. I replaced the case through Amazon and the second one is also defective. OtterBox invited me to call Customer Service for a replacement case and now I need to pay an additional $4.99 to have a working case sent to me by OtterBox. Clearly, OtterBox has given up on Quality Control AND on Customer Service.DO NOT BUY THIS CASE UNTIL OTTERBOX PROVIDES A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE!!!!UPDATED 10/5/17 - The replacement case finally arrived via FedEx SmartPost. The screen protector is perfectly attached to the side of the shell and there doesn't appear to be any gap between the screen and the phone. This suggests the first release of iPhone 8+ cases likely had a manufacturing defect which was corrected in stock sent to OtterBox. Check your case for screen protector alignment issues before the Amazon return policy expires and if you do need to go through OtterBox for a warranty exchange, expect to pay for shipping and handling.",
            "If you want ultimate protection, this is the case for you. But if want a case to show how slim your new iPhone is, look elsewhere. To give you an idea on the thickness, on the back around the Apple logo and camera is about a quarter inch of protection. Again, great case, small hands beware.",
            "I\u2019ve used OtterBox in the past and sometimes felt it was beyond the protection I needed.  The cases have always been made sturdy, easy to put together, and built to last.  The OtterBox remains one of the leading brands for phone case protection and I feel the brand continues to improve the case design that aligns with phone innovations.Usually, I don\u2019t gravitate towards colorful cases but the rosemarine/plum haze color is fun and not overbearing.  I also enjoy the color combination with my rose gold iPhone 7 Plus and feel that it compliments it.  The case comes in 3 pieces and is easy to put together.  The inner layer consists of two hard plastic pieces that snap around the case, one side includes the screen protector.  The outer shell is a rubbery flexible material that covers the area where the inner pieces connect and add extra protection.I\u2019m very impressed with the screen protection with this Otterbox.  In my opinion, the screen protector feels better than using the solo film screen protectors.  Not better than glass, but I have the luck of breaking glass ones after a couple of days.  The screen protector also doesn\u2019t have the annoying bubbles and doesn\u2019t cling to a speck of dust.  The only parts of the phone that are consistently exposed are the speakers and the cameras.  The buttons are covered and are fully functional without difficulty.  The lightning port and the switch to set your iPhone 7 Plus to silent are covered with the rubber but you can open them.The only downfall I used to have with the Otterbox was the size.  Now that the iPhone 7 Plus is much slimmer I feel the case is a better fit.  I can\u2019t use the Otterbox with my lightning dock but not many cases on my phone allow me to use it anyway.Overall, the Otterbox Defender for the iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent choice for people with an active lifestyle or professions that put your phone at risk for damage.  The Otterbox is one of those cases that if I were to drop my phone I wouldn\u2019t gasp and cringe in fear because I know it\u2019s thoroughly protected.",
            "I had just bought a new iPhone 7 Plus and I wanted a good case for protective purposes. In the past there had always been occasions when somehow, no matter how careful I was, I managed to drop my cellular phones. In addition, not only did I drop it, but I somehow always managed to drop it onto either a concrete or asphalt surface. At least 2 cell phones I had broken that way, so I was looking for a case that featured \"protection\" as the primary functionality feature of the case I bought. This time, I decided I was not going to make the same mistake again. Thus, I did a search for highly protective iPhone 7 plus compatible cases.Amazon has a huge collection of cases, even ones that are protective. Some even use special military grade plastics. Yet I wanted one that would allow easy access to all the features of my cell phone. This one achieves those objectives, without creating any barriers to access of all my new phone's features. Thus, I chose this one which did everything on my list of requirements.The best results and comments I can make about this \"Otterbox Defender Series Case\" is the following:  1). Installation is trivial and simple  2). Access to every feature and button is easy  3)  AND, the case is very PROTECTIVE!!!How do I know? Because within 48 hours of my installation I was getting out of my car, when I dropped it on the cement parking lot. So, I said to myself, \"Well, that is why I bought this one, so let's see if it is still working.And, Voila, every single function and button still worked. Nothing was damaged, and it greeted me immediately with perfect functionality! In addition, since that time I have dropped the phone 3 more times. Once on my hardwood floor, once on my asphalt parking lot driveway and once again on the concrete slab of my garage and every time it worked perfectly.Note please that all the drops were from an altitude of approximately waist high, therefore about 3 to 4 feet from impact. I decided that in every respect, this Otterbox Defender Series case was a perfect selection for meeting all my criteria. However, I would not attempt to find the limits of its protection. Thus, I do not recommend high altitude drops or throwing the phone and case to the concrete, but for normal use, including accidental drops this product fits the bill in every respect (I did not test for water) and thus I was totally satisfied and gave this product a well earned 5 Star rating. If good accidental drop protection is what you need, then I strongly recommend this product!",
            "The case goes on and comes off easy, dropped more than once on pavement(butterfingers) phone protected. Only two things I dont like about it are the plastic screen protector that it comes with already attached, terrible, zero protection from anything but dust, Last couple of these for other phones I just took the plastic off and the glue that attaches it and got the glass screen protector that I know offers real protection from minor impacts. The second thing is not a big deal but I figured  I\u2019d mention it, the case does increase the size of the already big phone slightly, the otterbox commuter case is thinner but I like the all rubber exterior of this one over the mostly hard plastic case of the commuter whch I also owned, the all rubber just makes the grip much more secure in your hand. Both cases offer superior protection in my opinion.",
            "What the hell is the point of getting a NEW defender case when it comes completely smeared?! This will be the second one I\u2019ve purchased the first one was fine this one looks like it fell out at the warehouse and dirty fingerprints are all over it.",
            "UPDATE- Very disappointed in otter box quality of this case. I may have received a weak and defective product. The white plastic part of the case has snapped inside the soft cover. People use these cases on construction sites with no problems. I go to school, work, and home. There should be no reason why my case has broken after 2 months of me having it. The rest of the case is in perfect condidtion. Also another downside to this open part at the top of the phone is I have to open the case to clean lint and debris from the screen every couple of weeks. That whole also lets water through so if I forget to flip the phone over while I\u2019m at the sink I have to clean water out of the case(which is how I found this break)Very pretty medium dark teal with white shell looks great on my black phone. Fit is sleek at a little under a dimes width for thickness. Durability fantastic obviously otter box is know for being one of the best for protection. The dad clip I\u2019ll admit I use. It helps my small hands hold onto this huge phone kind of like a popsocket would. The clip is also the perfect size to fit in my car door cup holder so I can use my phone for gps. Case does not obstruct the sound quality. Dislikes- although the screen protector does protect my screen from scratches it doesn\u2019t not stop debris from getting in the case. I did not want to have a built in screen protector. I wanted tempered glass but every case with this level of fall protection has a built in protector. I also don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t have the apple logo centered in the circle in the back.I am afraid that this rubber part will start to warp and loosen. Will update with progress of that aspect.",
            "I have been a otter box fan/ user since they came out, all my cells have had them. I just upgraded my phone and i got my case in the mail. I have never experienced almost having to slam my finger down on my screen to be able to text or unlock it. the screen cover has made it almost impossible to use my phone without slamming the screen. I am so disappointed right now with this case.",
            "This is a great case, but you have to remove the built-in screen protector. The gap between the protector and your phone\u2019s glass is insane \u2014 you have to press so much harder just to initiate a tap on your phone. AND it\u2019s loud! It sounds like you\u2019re tap dancing when you text someone.Solution: Remove the built-in protector. Grab a knife and start cutting it out, get rid of it, and apply one of those adhesive high-impact glass screen protectors before you put the case on. Much better."

            "I used to find these Beefy- tees in Walmart years ago. My husband needs the 2x. Then they stopped carrying them. One day, when my brain was working, I decided to peruse through Amazon. I couldn't believe my luck, when I found the Hanes Beefy tees. So I ordered 12. But you have to know: The ones I purchased at Wal-Mart 10 years ago, are still holding up, (barely). If you are married to a larger size man, or if YOU happen to be one, these are THE best quality t-shirts you'll ever find, or wear. They stand up to hundreds of washings, and the color seletion is superb. But the most important thing to us, is that they are 100% cotten. Best quality for your money.",
            "NOT TAGLESS. Pretty sure I got a knock off,  it has 2 cheap big tags. It is not \"beefy\" it is thin. Every other Hanes Beefy Tee(at least 5) I have bought are tagless with thick cotton. Will never buy from this seller again...\"Clothing Shop Online\"",
            "This shirt is very well made with a thick weave.  The color matches the picture even after repeated washings and there is no noticeable shrinkage even after tumble-drying on my dryer's highest setting.  I also tried applying iron-on transfers made for dark t-shirts to one of them and it worked beautifully.  I would recommend washing the shirt first, however, before trying to apply any iron-on transfer.",
            "I ordered a medium, which according to Haynes is for chests 38-40. My chest is exactly 40. When I tried the shirt on it was skin tight; so tight that I actually had some problems peeling it off. I then measured the shirt front just below the armpits and it was 19\" wide; times two is 38\". This explains why it was so tight for a 40 chest. As far as \"beefy\" was concerned, my opinion is that it's not. It's not thin, but neither is it heavy. Hanes used to sell a true \"beefy\" T, which I wore for probably 10 years, but a few years ago they cheapened the product.I had also been considering buying similar shirts from LL Bean or Land's End, but those cost 3 times as much; around $18 each, I decided to return the Hanes shirts and see what the much higher price of a LL Bean shirt would get me. When the shirts arrived I did some comparisons. The LL Bean shirt chest front measured 22\" (compared to 19\" for the Hanes) and it weighed 7.6  oz compared to 6.5 oz for the Haines; i.e. the LL Bean shirt was beefier than the Hanes, even though it was described as standard weight.Is it worth 3 times the price? Probably not. Just order one size up, don't expect a heavy weight shirt, and you'll probably be happy and definitely richer.",
            "I don\u2019t know why I just don\u2019t understand that you get what you pay for.I bought two of these, one Royal Blue and one Black.After washing and drying on a low setting, the overall shrinkage was minimal but as I suspected might happen, the bottom of the shirt folds up below the bottom seam. It is almost impossible to get it to fold back. Spraying a mist of water and adding a few clothes pins helps but that\u2019s just ridiculous.In addition to that, the seams where the sleeves are sewn to the body of the shirt are all puckered. It\u2019s impossible to flatten them, even ironing them.They are just plain old garbage and I should have paid double for one shirt...at least I would have had a wearable shirt instead of none.",
            "Junk!  These used to be like G.I. issue shirts long ago.  Now they include stretched out neck bands which get larger when washed!  I'm sorry I bought them, typical Asia made shirts with poor quality.  Seams were not uniform as well.  I've heard that the Costco shirts may be better.  Amazon did have a good price on these shirts, but I'm sorry that I purchased them.",
            "This is not \"beefy\" at all! I have a few Hanes Beefy T-shirts from a couple of years back and those are of the real quality: 100% cotton, no BS.The new t-shirt is 90% cotton + 10% polyester: you can see the daylight through the fabric. I's expect these to go through 4-5 wash cycles and become a rag. For the $6 it doesn't worth the trouble of returning it. But be aware.",
            "I keep coming back to buy more of these.  These are great work shirts and just general usage shirts and the only decent t-shirt with a pocket anymore.* Durability for cheap.  For $7 a shirt you get a fairly beefy cotton that doesn't rip the instant it catches on anything.  It holds up well in the wash.  The dye doesn't seem to fade.  I can't tell the difference between two year old and two month old shirts.* Pocket is nice.  It's big enough to stuff your phone into it, but its better suited to light items that won't fall out due to gravity if you bend forward and stuff that you can clip to the edge of the pocket.  Business cards, paper notes, pens, and small flashlights with pocket clips all do well in the pocket.  If you put a phone in it expect it to flop out on the concrete if you bend forward more than 45 degrees.* Consistency.  I've bought 8 of these so far, two at a time over the course of about two years as I replaced my other work t-shirts.  The sizing has not been altered in that time, nor has the material weight.  I can't even tell the difference between the shirts from two years ago and the most recent ones, they don't even seem to have worn.* Modest cut.  They lean toward the boxy side which is fine if you aren't trying to show off.  If you're a little on the pudgy side it's actually preferable.  When I first got these I was about 195 at 6'1\", two years later I've slimmed down while hitting the weights and sitting at 175 with a little more muscle in my upper torso and considerably less fat around my waist.  If you want to turn any heads or catch any eyes this is not your go to t-shirt.",
            "A few months ago I ordered a sample of these tshirts. They fit perfect and were nice and beefy. However after I reordered this time with the same seller, these tshirts were not the same. They were a lot thinner material and they did not have the tagless style. It seems like Hanes sold out just like the Rast of the t-shirt companies and opted for cheaper thin stretchy material. Very disappointing, since this was the last resort for thicker tshirts. They'll say it was the same thickness bit standards have definitely changed. I have the comparisons right here In front of me. I hate wasting money buying cloths online when they keep getting cheaper with quality.",
            "I think this is a knock off.  The shirt has tags and shrunk considerably in the first wash.  This is not a Hanes Beefy Tee quality shirt.  Must be a fake."

            "I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.",
            "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.",
            "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(",
            "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.",
            "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.",
            "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.",
            "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.",
            "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad",
            "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it.

            "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"

            "I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.",
            "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.",
            "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(",
            "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.",
            "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.",
            "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.",
            "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.",
            "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad",
            "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.",

            "I have had this protector as I feel it is was necessary to get it for my iPhone 8 plus. Being a recent convert from a Samsung Galaxy 5, I could no longer feel comfortable being responsibly gentle with an even larger and significantly heavier phone, so I looked for a case that wasn't too bulky, but also something that offered some protection. My first case was the Pursuit, but I felt it was too big, and the cover switch for the ringer did not work properly, so I returned it.After much research, and nearly buying a silicon case with fuzzy lining, I chose this. I went back to it because it was American made, which I felt meant it may have went through a strict quality control process, and I liked the feel of the pursuit case, despite the non-functioning ringer cover switch.I am happy with this purchase, and for the face of the phone that is not covered, I feel this product works well if you have a separate glass face protector. I am usually a bigger fan of single piece protectors, but not in the instance of a case where a touch screen is involved. I am also happy that this case was not as bulky as I expected, as I had planned to get a slimmer case for formal events. To me, this provides excellent protection without being bulky.This unit went on over my phone a little tight at first, as it was activating some of the side volume buttons as it was being fitted over my iPhone 8 Plus. But once on, it felt very snug. I like that the case feels nice with semi-grippy rubber around the side, but rigid and hard along the surfaces on the back at the same time. I guess I'm a tactile sort of person because besides liking the feel of this case in hand, I have no problems placing my phone down on hard concrete (which I would be nervous about doing with iPhones bare glass exterior) and enjoy that the phone feels protected in my front (yes, front) pocket as well, from shifting and or bending.An important feature to me is that the camera 'bump' is aligned in a fitted hole that gives it and the flash an ample opening and provides what feels to be a quarter's thickness to keep the bump from touching a surface if the case is placed camera-side down.The bottom cut-outs for the lightning cable and bottom speakers holes seem perfectly aligned for me, and the side buttons for the power and the volume controls are pleasantly stiff, which are find for me since I do not use them much and value the protection they provide for the little-used buttons. I also like that the ringer on/off switch is a simple cut-out rather than an attempted addition side button. I feel that this switch is, by design, something to correctly cover and have another working switch over it, as the Pursuit attempted to do.I highly recommend this case and I think it is an excellent value on Amazon at $28 at the time of purchase. I would be willing to bet it's nearly twice as much if you buy it at your local cell phone provider.Thank you for reading and I hope this review helps you.",
            "This is the fake GARBAGE that AMAZON Fullfilment sent to me! It\u2019s a FAKE KNOCK OFF of an Otterbox branded Symmetry Series case. Amazon\u2019s is made in China. The REAL Symmetry case from Otterbox is much different looking and comes in very expensive packaging!!! Total disappointment from Amazon today!!!",
            "The item I received is NOT a true Otterbox. The box that this cheap silicone/ rubber cover came in states \u201cStylish Coice, Fashion Case\u201d with an Otterbox sticker stuck crookedly on front. The \u201ccase\u201d does not have a hard back or a raised beveled edge. I know this is fake since I\u2019ve had one for my previous iPhone and it was a wonderful product. Otterbox box was also imprinted in the case. This \u201ccover\u201d does not have Otterbox on it anywhere. Returning immediately.** Added pics. I purchased a real one from Best Buy on left. They price matched Amazon. You can see the flimsy fake in second pic and the true Otterbox in last two pics.",
            "I've had this case for almost 10 months so I think I can speak definitively about this.Look I know I'm the kind of person who drops stuff. I'm also the kind of person who likes to go out which makes me a 2x kind of person who drops stuff. So when I'm getting a case, it's a short term relationship.Not this son of a gun. Let me tell you the ways I've dropped this - off of a desk, off a ladder, accidentally threw across the street, sneezed so hard it flew out of my hands and hit the wall, angrily made hand movement and it slipped out, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on a couch, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on the floor,  dropped in a pot of water (that probably has more to do with the phones water resistance but STILL), thrown as a joke, thrown as not a joke, adamant gesticulation, demonstrating how hard my brother's head was by hitting him with it (would not recommend), trying to impress girlfriend, dropped every day.Seriously, as someone who drops their phone both intentionally and unintentionally, I cannot recommend this case enough. Also it looks good, I love the color, it's light and is the slimmest case that will still protect your phone to a degree that you legitimately don't have to worry about it if you're a class A phone dropper.",
            "Case seems to protect the phone well enough but it scratches very easily and the scratches make it very slippery and hard to hold. After only having the case for a short time it already looks terrible. Not a good design, next time I\u2019ll be going with something other than OtterBox.",
            "Terrible...I always trust otter box with my phones. This case however let me down. It is really pretty but pretty poor quality. The back got scratched from just placing it on a table, and not to mention the color transfer from any clothing item you wear. I\u2019m disappointed I paid so much money for this disappointing case \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",
            "Did not protect the back of my phone from breaking.  My phone was in my coat pocket and I was bent down getting something from the floor of my car when my phone slipped out of my pocket and fell to the driveway. I didn\u2019t even cringe, it was such a small distance and didn\u2019t sound like a hard fall. Very shocked to see the cracks across the back. Ive trusted in this brand for years and was very disappointed!",
            "I give one star because I can\u2019t give a 0... In the features says STAY- CLEAR / ANTI-YELLOWING, one of the main reasons I bought it. But after a week using it it\u2019s horrible. Looks like it\u2019s 2 colors! All the edge it\u2019s yellow, looks dirty. DONT BUY IT !",
            "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It is very protective yet fashionable. She\u2019s dropped her phone multiple times from pretty high with his case on and her phone stayed safe; the case did not take any damage either. It came in the nice packaging and also came with a warranty. (The white splotches seen on the case in the photos are just from the flash.) I hope this review helps! \ud83d\ude04",
            "Ugh I had high hopes for this one, but I dropped my phone twice..and not from a skyscraper.. from less than 3 feet and both times my glass protector cracked.. thankfully I had the protector on it, but I have had the same screen protector on my phone since December ($40) and have dropped it many times without a scratch.. but since this case doesn\u2019t actually cover the phone.. the phone touches the ground first instead of the case.. and that\u2019s why it cracked it.. I went back to the other series and so far so good..Another thing ..the phone is hella slippery when your trying to use it.. no grip what so ever ..The only thing I liked was that I could use the Apple mirror in the back since it was see through"

            "I wanted people to see how this shirt was cut! My 6yo grandson put it on and it is so wide, but not even long enough to cover his stomach! It looks like a toddler size cut too wide! Awful! I requested a return, and found out that I'd have to pay for the return! It cost me $5 to get the darn thing shipped, not spending another $5 to return a $7.95 defective shirt. Lesson learned!",
            "These are wonderful, colorful shirts with interesting designs and good quality. The sizes are just a bit smaller than I expected, so I'd advise beer-bellied men to buy one size larger than we're used to. Hey, we came from the 60s and now we're approaching our 70s. We need a bit more room than we used to...I was walking down the street, and a 12-yr-old shouted, \"Nice shirt!\" from across the street. I don't get that kinda compliment very often anymore, so I bought a second shirt of the same brand.",
            "High quality shirt -- no loose threads or defects, great colors, beautiful design. But although the shirt fit very well for my size (XXL) around the chest and across the shoulders, it was almost exactly a full 6\" longer than standard. I don't tuck my t-shirts in so I look just plain silly when the shirt that goes down to my thighs. I tried tucking it in to compensate. That didn't turn out so well either -- it filled up my pants with huge, unsightly, and uncomfortable bulges. Because I hate making returns, I actually went out to buy a sewing machine at the Goodwill, trained myself how to use it, and then trimmed and seamed the bottom hem. But that seams like a lot of extra work to correct a manufacturing defect. If it wasn't a defect than they're using some very low-waisted, long-torsoed clothing dummies/sewing mannequins for the shirt length of their XXL size.  But excellent service and fast delivery",
            "(Rainbow and Pastel Rainbow) I absolutely love this shirt. I like my shirts to fit loose and a bit baggy, its comfy that way, so I originally ordered a large but that was a bit too large for me (true to size, it was just my fault for ordering wrong size), I am about 125lb and about 5foot8, but the large was easily returned and I ordered a medium and it's perfect, loose but not too much so. It is really bright and pretty, fits great and is really comfy (they also don't shrink in the washer/dryer!) I wear it way too much, so I decided to also order the pastel rainbow one lol. They are both really pretty I wear them a lot, actually wearing the pastel one as I write this. They don't bleed in the wash and the color lasts, I have washed them a lot. The quality of the shirts is good. Pretty much I really like them and you get one if youre thinking about it lol. I plan to order more in different colors....",
            "I LOVE MY TIE-DYED TEE SHIRT!!!! I have wanted one of these since they were in style back in the day! I wore the two I had until they were too holey for outside wear. :) This one is BEAUTIFUL! I LOVE the rainbow colors! The actual tee shirt looks exactly like the image here, thank you very much! I ordered 2XL because I wasn't sure if this 2XL was small or actual size. This one is actual size, thus 2XL is bigger than I prefer, but I can just knot it on the size or back and wear it young and teenagery. THANK YOU for your product matching the advertising. Haven't washed it yet, but I should have some room for shrinkage (if it even shrinks).",
            "Better than I expected. I purchased this shirt for as part of a \"hippie\" costume for my 17 year old son who is a very picky dresser. He actually liked the shirt. The cotton was soft. When I washed it the colors did not fade or run. I am pretty impressed with the quality.",
            "It's awesome, its colorful, shirt is good quality.  It did shrink a little when I dried it with heat but that's ok because it was a bit large to start with.  I am not sure it's large for a 4x but it was large for me because I wanted it oversize. It just turned out to be a little more over-sized than I counted on so the dryer is helping with that.  It did not shrink the first wash when I used cold water and cool dryer setting.",
            "I'm a size small/xs in girl's in the teen section. The size small in this shirt fits me like a short dress and it's baggy but i expected that. I just tuck it in my pants and roll up the sleeves. The color is vibrant and beautiful. I love it.",
            "I love this T-shirt. The shirt itself is a nice quality and of an adequate length. I'm 5'11\" and prefer a shirt that leans toward tall &amp; narrow. The tie-dying on it is beautifully done! The colors are bold, edges are sharp, none of the colors are muddy. I own a lot of tie-dye shirts &amp; this is definitely my new favorite. This is the shirt I will reach for if I am in a good mood or when I'm not but want to be. I have had long enough to wash it a few times already &amp; the colors are staying true. I've heard that if you add a cup of vinegar to the washer when washing your new tie-dye shirts that it helps set the color. I forgot to do that this time, but the colors still look bright &amp; clear. I'm super-happy with this purchase &amp; will likely order more as gifts.",

It is same size as her other youth M shirts made by different companies.  I can already see that she'll want to wear this shirt... a lot!*i have not washed the shirt yet so I can't speak to the colors running or how well it holds up in wash.

            "I notice that many people are complaining about the number of pages the ink prints.  I too had this problem at first.  The solution was simple.  I put the settings on draft which prints the same quality with less ink.  Standard print eats a lot of ink and if you put it on best it definitely consumes ink really quick.  I keep my printer set on draft and change it to standard only when doing special printing such as t-shirts, invitations or greeting cards.  When the light comes on that means that you have at least 50 pages (sometimes more) that you can print before you run out of ink.  I was able to put the cartridges I removed (because of the low ink light) back into the printer and got 50 or more pages out of them.  Just glad I decided to try it before I threw the cartridges away.  I hope this helps.",
            "Yes, this was easy to install.  No, it wasn't worth the purchase price.  I printed out about 15 pages and all of a sudden my low ink light was back on.  Yes, the printer was inexpensive, but I have since tossed it because the cost of the ink was going to bankrupt me.  I am very disappointed because I liked the printer.  This is no deal.  Maybe if you print something every week or two, but not good for daily use.",
            "Didn't seem to last as long as I expected.  But that may be misleading, since it starts telling you your ink levels are low when the cartridge is maybe one-half consumed. The Pop-up warning screen shows the ink level to be like maybe 5%, when you still have lots of ink left.  So, don't replace the cartridge until it actually stops printing.  For me, that was at least one hundred copies later.",
            "This is the first time I ordered just the black ink (I usually get the combo) but there is no reason it should be such a poor product...they are the same thing. This printed 10 pages vs 25 with the one I got in the combo pack. I couldn't finish my project even. NEVER again!",
            "Would of gave it five stars but could only afford 4 after buying ink lol",
            "I am very dissapointed. I put this in today and after making four copies my printer says I need new ink.",
            "As with all Canon ink cartridges, runs out much too quickly. This was never a problem some years back but most definitely is now. I used to print regularly and only had to replace ink every few months but now it seems even with hardly printing anything at all, the ink runs out. It is getting to where buying a new printer is cheaper than buying ink!",
            "Lasted for about 15 sheets. Very much a scam. I thought i was imagining things, or perhaps doing something wrong with the printer settings but, after reading others\u2019 reviews, I\u2019ve concluded it\u2019s a scam. I saved 5 cartridges I have bought and used in about one year, and I hardly ever print. Waste of money, shipping and packaging. Someone should complain that this is FRAUDULENT.",
            "works well and easy to install, swapping cartridges takes 15 seconds. For some reason, the canon printers burn lots of black ink. It could be the consumption rate or the cartridge itself that requires this much ink. I don't print much so it isn't a issue.PS: Based on the supreme court decision in Lexmark v. Impression, it is fully legal and permissible for a third party to fill your ink cartridges. Not sure if there is one yet for this cartridge, but maybe worth a search? Hope that saves you some money!",
            "It just doesn't seem fair that these ink cartridges are so darn expensive. The quality of re-manufactured or other brand cartridges is just the same, but the problem is that Canon printers detect them and flash up a warning and won't work with anything of a reasonable cost. So we are stuck with buying Canon's new ones.Canon compensates by selling the printer for $34! The Canon printer is wonderful and definitely my favorite among all the many other brands I've owned. But it doesn't seem fair that the ink is so very expensive -- not much of a discount for buying in bulk, either.I'd be happier if they would do good discounts if you are buying 3 or more. Give the consumer a break."

Unknowingly I proceeded to drive to park and run over it! Thankfully it was perfectly fine! The screen protector however didn\u2019t get so lucky. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the performance of this case! Recommend to everyone! -Rebeca\u2019s husband",

This case does not fit properly, the edges are exposed and flimsy. I\u2019d be worried if I drop it. This is not for iPhone Xs. I am hugely disappointed. Openings at the bottom for mike is bigger than required (looks like they sent the cover for iPhone Xs). Camera and apple logo on the back of the phone do not properly fit at the center of the openings.  This is a huge disappointment since its a costly cover then it should fit in the iPhone Xs.",

For years I didn\u2019t have one crack.  I got the new iphone XS two weeks ago and just a few days into using this case the screen is cracked. You can tell that this case isn\u2019t as good as the older version of the same model because it doesn\u2019t come up as high around the sides of the screen so it can\u2019t provide as much protection.

Not a single scratch has appeared from the numerous drops.Cons:  The reason I keep dropping my phone is the hard outer shell is super slick.  Imagine dipping your hands into olive oil and then picking up your phone.  That is how slick this case is.  There is no texture to the outer shell.  You will accidentally drop your phone with this case...numerous times.  The good news is, it is awesome at protecting the phone from the inevitable drops.",

With all my previous Otterbox cases the two part system has worked really well and both layers feel of quality. This case has a cheap rubber that is not flexible as they have been before and and doesn\u2019t fit like a glove. The plastic is lacking the support to keep the rubber tightly against the phone especially on the top half of the phone.",
            "I bought the symmetry case clear and it was scratched up in a week. This case has more protection and is just as slim! Weighs more yes, but it\u2019s worth it. 1,000 dollar phone deserves this case. Don\u2019t be cheap!  Plus you get the opening in the back for the Apple LogoWorks with WIRELESS CHARGING TOO",
            "I got this for my new iPhone Xs as I loved the Commuter case on my previous iPhone 7.  Overall I did not feel like this case fit the phone well. Not sure if this is an issue with the Xs or just the overall design of the case.  The rubber portion felt loose and spongy, especially around the side button and camera while the outer plastic piece felt like it was too small and never felt completely secure over the rubber.  Things just didn't line up or look tidy.I just ordered and received the Otterbox Symmetry Case which feels perfect on my phone.  Seems like a much more secure fit and doesn't seem to sacrifice anything on protection.  Love Otterbox and their products, but the Commuter on the iPhone Xs is a \"miss\" for me",
            "I was really excited to get this case but disappointed when I got it. I have always had a Defender case and this doesn\u2019t feel as safe as I\u2019m used to. There is only rubber on the inside and slightly on the edges so I doesn\u2019t grip that well when holding or using on the side. Also there is no clear protector for the circle in the back which is what made me decide to return it. Great case for someone who is careful with their phone just not someone who wants to feel protected."

            "I have had this protector as I feel it is was necessary to get it for my iPhone 8 plus. Being a recent convert from a Samsung Galaxy 5, I could no longer feel comfortable being responsibly gentle with an even larger and significantly heavier phone, so I looked for a case that wasn't too bulky, but also something that offered some protection. My first case was the Pursuit, but I felt it was too big, and the cover switch for the ringer did not work properly, so I returned it.After much research, and nearly buying a silicon case with fuzzy lining, I chose this. I went back to it because it was American made, which I felt meant it may have went through a strict quality control process, and I liked the feel of the pursuit case, despite the non-functioning ringer cover switch.I am happy with this purchase, and for the face of the phone that is not covered, I feel this product works well if you have a separate glass face protector. I am usually a bigger fan of single piece protectors, but not in the instance of a case where a touch screen is involved. I am also happy that this case was not as bulky as I expected, as I had planned to get a slimmer case for formal events. To me, this provides excellent protection without being bulky.This unit went on over my phone a little tight at first, as it was activating some of the side volume buttons as it was being fitted over my iPhone 8 Plus. But once on, it felt very snug. I like that the case feels nice with semi-grippy rubber around the side, but rigid and hard along the surfaces on the back at the same time. I guess I'm a tactile sort of person because besides liking the feel of this case in hand, I have no problems placing my phone down on hard concrete (which I would be nervous about doing with iPhones bare glass exterior) and enjoy that the phone feels protected in my front (yes, front) pocket as well, from shifting and or bending.An important feature to me is that the camera 'bump' is aligned in a fitted hole that gives it and the flash an ample opening and provides what feels to be a quarter's thickness to keep the bump from touching a surface if the case is placed camera-side down.The bottom cut-outs for the lightning cable and bottom speakers holes seem perfectly aligned for me, and the side buttons for the power and the volume controls are pleasantly stiff, which are find for me since I do not use them much and value the protection they provide for the little-used buttons. I also like that the ringer on/off switch is a simple cut-out rather than an attempted addition side button. I feel that this switch is, by design, something to correctly cover and have another working switch over it, as the Pursuit attempted to do.I highly recommend this case and I think it is an excellent value on Amazon at $28 at the time of purchase. I would be willing to bet it's nearly twice as much if you buy it at your local cell phone provider.Thank you for reading and I hope this review helps you.",

I'm also the kind of person who likes to go out which makes me a 2x kind of person who drops stuff. So when I'm getting a case, it's a short term relationship.Not this son of a gun. Let me tell you the ways I've dropped this - off of a desk, off a ladder, accidentally threw across the street, sneezed so hard it flew out of my hands and hit the wall, angrily made hand movement and it slipped out, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on a couch, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on the floor,  dropped in a pot of water (that probably has more to do with the phones water resistance but STILL), thrown as a joke, thrown as not a joke, adamant gesticulation, demonstrating how hard my brother's head was by hitting him with it (would not recommend), trying to impress girlfriend, dropped every day.Seriously, as someone who drops their phone both intentionally and unintentionally, I cannot recommend this case enough. Also it looks good, I love the color, it's light and is the slimmest case that will still protect your phone to a degree that you legitimately don't have to worry about it if you're a class A phone dropper.",

            "Terrible...I always trust otter box with my phones. This case however let me down. It is really pretty but pretty poor quality. The back got scratched from just placing it on a table, and not to mention the color transfer from any clothing item you wear.

            "I ordered this bag in size small for the gym, and it fit my essentials with room to spare. I packed up my protein shaker, three 16oz water bottles, a small backpack, gloves, towel, diapers/wipes/snacks for my kids among other necessities and could still fit maybe 20% more. I posted pics wearing the bag so you can see how large the \u201csmall\u201d size is. It\u2019s lightweight but feels well made, and the material feels like it should be easy to clean. I am so happy with this bag!",
            "Ok so I was trying to find a bag that worked for my 12 year old for volleyball. She had a book bag for school and wanted something small enough she could fit in her locker with her book bag. The small seemed like it might be too big. They are small lockers... and they can\u2019t carry bags at school. I wanted so bad to see reviews of the extra small but I couldn\u2019t find them so I took a chance and I\u2019m glad I did. I can fit her volleyball shoes in the side pockets still, her uniform, water bottle, inhaler, and a volleyball in her bag. Everything she needs fits great. Hopefully this helps if anyone is wondering what I was...is it \u201ctoo\u201d small... nope!",
            "I wanted something I could use for a weekend worth of clothes and still be carried onto an airline. This is a good size. I was really torn between the medium and small. After checking the medium in person at a local store it's way too big compared to this. Bag seems well made and zippers are good quality and the carry handles are seen on nice. Can't wait to load it up with stuff and see how it holds.",
            "i love the fit, i wore this to work as a dress shirt, i'm a female 180 lbs and a small fits just right",
            "This is huge disapointment. The bag looks good, but poorly designed.I bought small size, the ad video said it's a shoe compartment and it appears to be a shoe compartment too. I have man shoe size 10, and it doesn't fit that I cannot zip the compartment.While my other bag which is much smaller than this one can store the same shoe easily in its shoe compartment (see photos)If you want a nice looking bag, this bag is an option. But if you want a funtional compact bag with usable shoe compartment, DON'T BUY THE SMALL SIZE (not sure about the larger size)",
            "So I ordered a medium size. Upon arrival I enthusiastically opened the package and inspected my new gym bag. I'm pretty sure I ordered brand new, either that or I missed the fine print where it said \"complementary women's hair scrunchie inside\" hence the 4 star rating. My wife and I laughed but I'm disappointed. I paid for brand new and got a used bag. (Buying and returning with accessories left in bag is considered used in my opinion) it didnt even have to under armour tag on it \ud83d\ude31",
            "Perfect size duffel bag. I was able to fit three days worth of clothing for a weekend golf trip. Three polo shirts, three pairs of shorts, one pair of pants, two T-shirts, one pair of gym shorts,  One pair sneakers, socks, underwear, my toiletry bag, Kindleand headphones with room to spare.  I love the look, held up well on its first test. Would recommend",
            "This Bag fits all my 9 year old daughter\u2019s needs.She currently uses it as a basketball bag, she packs her basketball, slide sandals, basketball sneakers, extra clothing, water bottle and more. Bag is very roomy and I feel it could be used for any age. The vented shoe compartment is a huge plus for an athlete.We love how the bright colors pop against the black, it is a very attractive bag.Could be used for multiple sports or a sleepover bag for travel.Definitely would purchase another bag like this!Very nice quality.",
            "I\u2019ve had my old UA bag for going on ten years. It\u2019s old but still holding together. I ordered a new one, cheaper material, no rubber pads on bottom, cheaper zipper, thin fabric. No reinforcements in the straps, just sewn into the seam.  I carry my chains for doing weighted dips in my bag and other items.  I don\u2019t think this would last 2 months. It\u2019s going back.",
            "I love my gym bag! Prior to writing the review, I legitimately tried to think of any cons to share with you all about the bag. I have nothing! The only thing that I would tell you is to be aware that this is a LARGE bag. Meaning, if you are of average height, it may look a little odd on you. You may have to play with the straps a bit to get it how you want it. Personally, I could care less about that.I literally store everything I need for the gym into this bag: my \"under clothes\", shirt, pants, shoes, bag to keep my dirty clothes in, shower towel, workout towel, earbuds, Kindle, shaker cup, and shake mix. Even after I have all that in the bag, there is still a bunch more space left that is left unused.So, if you need a high quality bag to put all your stuff in, this is it!"

I put on a few pounds in the belly region and needed shirts that would cover up my gut. I hate standing there feeling a cool breeze on my stomach only to realize it's because my fat is sticking out. These shirts do the trick. Sure I'm still fat but at least these shirts help cover the skin up so I don't scare random people sending them screaming and crying only to be traumatized for the rest of their lives.Update: I just ordered for the third time.",
            "This is one issue I've had with the few clothing purchases I've made on line... so often what you see is NOT what you get, which is why I don't often resort to it. I ordered the \"assorted earth tones\" 4 pack, and when you click on the assorted earth tones, what's shown are shirts that look like a steel blue, a brown, an olive green, and I guess what they're calling a \"heather grey\". The description says that they're all 100% cotton, with the exception of the heather grey, which is 90% cotton, 10% polyester. Well, the most important part of the product description is the part that says \"colors may vary\" - you ain't kiddin'!What I ended up getting were two of the EXACT SAME same grayish-blue shirts (90% cotton, 10% polyester) rather than steel blue, a much lighter shade of brown than shown (90% cotton, 10% polyester), and a teal shirt rather than the olive (the ONLY one that's 100% cotton!)These are for my hard-working, blue collar hubby, and he's not really going to care what the colors are - he's always been completely satisfied with the Fruit of the Loom pocket tees I've purchased in the past (he's a big guy, we buy the 3XL size, he likes the way they fit him), and it's nice that they're all tag-less now. But the shirts in this pack are made in El Salvador, and here's what the washing instructions say: \"Para Mexico Lavar Con Detergente/No Exprimir\". My high school Spanish class was a lifetime ago! And I expect to get the colors featured in the \"assorted earth tones\" photo accompanying the choice I clicked on - surely not TWO of the same color, which wasn't even shown!  We like the shirts - just not the misinformation.",
            "Bought these T-shirts for my son and husband as they are the only shirts my son will wear.  But something has changed and these do not fit like the last ones we bought in the store.  They run small and too long.PROS:  They are soft and don't get twisted when washed.  There is some minimal pilling after multiple wears (like six months of every day wear) but that is to be expected.  Price is great as you get 4 shirts for the price and one shirt in the stores costs $6.CONS:  Size is off.  My son wears a XL and fits XL in other FOL shirts. These ones are way too tight and too long for him.  He said they feel like he's wearing a tube sock as a top. Also, going by the picture we expected two darker grey and two blue but received 3 blue (light blue, darker deep blue, and a grayish blue) and a light grey shirt.",
            "With this product you get 4 crew neck t-shirts at an inexpensive price.These undershirts are made of cotton which makes them soft and comfortable.The branding and sizing information is stamped on the back of the inside of these shirts, which is great because there are no tags to cause irritation and itching.These undershirts are fairly thin and lightweight, so if you are doing some heavy construction work (or yard work, or etc.) they aren't the most durable.It must be noted that these undershirts will shrink after a couple washes, which could mean trouble for people who wear these tighter to begin with or have long torsos.I purchased these undershirts to wear under my polo shirts at work.  They fit well and I am still able to tuck them into my pants (even after shrinking in the wash), so I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend that you purchase these undershirts if you have similar needs.-In Short-Pros:InexpensiveComfortableAssorted colorsCons:Will shrink after a few washesNot the most durable*Please click \"Yes\" if you found this review helpful. It would be appreciated. Thank you.",
            "I bought these for my fella, who's a  6' 2\", muscular built man. He works outdoors, at a ranch, and like pockets on his t-shirts to carry a note pad for easy access. So these t-shirts fit all his needs at a reasonable price ($14.00 for a 5-pack in April 2019).I noticed other people reviewing said they shrunk. Well, duh. ALL t-shirts shrink if you put them in the dyer. For that matter, everything shrinks if dried long enough.  We don't do that. Just hang the freshly washed t-shirt on a plastic hanger, pull the wrinkles out while it's wet, and they won't shrink. Problem solved. They'll last longer, too. (Hint: You can do the same thing with jeans, etc. Towels line dried (or hung in the bathroom if you live in an apt or it's raining) are a little stiff when first dried but fluff out fine as soon as they hit your damp skin. To hang items like jeans and slacks, save &amp; reuse the plastic snap hangers that come with new clothing.  Line drying saves money, prolongs the life of the material  and works almost as well as if you had actually IRONED your clothing if done right.)",
            "These shirts fit perfectly! And they arrived pretty quickly, as well. The material is great! It's pretty thick, which is not what I expected it all. These are some great quality shirts! The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 out 5 is that the colors do not match the picture at all. Instead of a royal blue and a bright red like the picture depicts, I received a burgundy/maroon and navy, along with the dark gray and black shirts. Hope this review was helpful lol :)",
            "So lately I have been tryna get into the fashion game and let me tell you, this is a step in the right direction. I went from looking like a average dude to an average dude who can kinda dress. Notice, that I am still an average dude. With that being said, these are fantastic shirts for a great price. I feel more comfortable shooting my shot with these shirts. That should clear some things.Note: I am like 5'4 so keep that in mind while reading this.",
            "As a woman, i find that sometimes man\u2019s T shirts are better than women\u2019s. I received a white, grey, navy and black one. I bought a medium.

            "Amazon sent me an email asking me to review these, probably because I keep buying them.I'm not very good at reviewing stuff, but, well...These are very good T-shirts.I mean, if you like T-shirts...Then these are very good T-shirts.(How come no one says my reviews are helpful? It's T-shirts, or boxer shorts...It's not like you're seeking advice on purchasing a pet badger or something. What do you want from me?)",

            "Say you were at a high school football game. Say you were sitting on the top of the bleachers. Say some old lady kicked your purse and your phone was on top. Say your phone skated in slo-mo into the gap in between the seats and walkway. Say you watched it careen the 15 feet or so to the ground below, into the dirt, under the bleachers. Say you looked at her and you knew she knew and she didn\u2019t even say sorry. Say you found a custodial guy eating a burger with a *LOT* of mustard. Say you complimented him on his hunk of keys and told him the tale. Say he unlocked a creepy gate under the bleachers and found your phone in THIS OTTERBOX and it was perfectly fine. This is what happened to me. Wish it were cuter? Say you put on a jungle PopSocket with pink flamingoes. I will NEVER get another case. Only me and the OTTERBOX.",
            "\u00a0I purchased this case for an iPhone 8 Plus. The first case Amazon sent lifts in the center causing a gap between the screen and the phone. I called OtterBox and filed a complaint. They said exchange the case with Amazon cause it's been less than 30 days. Amazon quickly sent me a second case. The second case had the exact same problem suggesting the new iPhone 8 Plus Defender Case may have quality control problems. Take a look at the photo I included with this review. The point where the plastic is connected to the case is lower on the bottom and the top then it is in the middle. The video shows the same anomaly - pressing on the screen causes the case to bend resulting in missed keypresses and harder contact. I am a huge fan of OtterBox Defender cases and my previous iPhone 6 case does NOT have this defect.UPDATED 9/26/17 - Per OtterBox's response to my review, I called Customer Service for a replacement case. A representative named Ariel took my call, looked up my incident number, and offered to help. I explained the issue with the case and OtterBox's response to my review. Ariel apologized for the defect and placed me on hold to speak with a Supervisor. Upon return, Ariel offered to complete a Warranty exchange for a new case to be sent out. I said that sounds good until Ariel asked me to pay $4.99 for Shipping and Handling. I said, let me get this straight, I ordered a new case through Amazon and it arrived defective. I replaced the case through Amazon and the second one is also defective. OtterBox invited me to call Customer Service for a replacement case and now I need to pay an additional $4.99 to have a working case sent to me by OtterBox. Clearly, OtterBox has given up on Quality Control AND on Customer Service.DO NOT BUY THIS CASE UNTIL OTTERBOX PROVIDES A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE!!!!UPDATED 10/5/17 - The replacement case finally arrived via FedEx SmartPost. The screen protector is perfectly attached to the side of the shell and there doesn't appear to be any gap between the screen and the phone. This suggests the first release of iPhone 8+ cases likely had a manufacturing defect which was corrected in stock sent to OtterBox. Check your case for screen protector alignment issues before the Amazon return policy expires and if you do need to go through OtterBox for a warranty exchange, expect to pay for shipping and handling.",
            "If you want ultimate protection, this is the case for you. But if want a case to show how slim your new iPhone is, look elsewhere. To give you an idea on the thickness, on the back around the Apple logo and camera is about a quarter inch of protection. Again, great case, small hands beware.",
            "I\u2019ve used OtterBox in the past and sometimes felt it was beyond the protection I needed.  The cases have always been made sturdy, easy to put together, and built to last.  The OtterBox remains one of the leading brands for phone case protection and I feel the brand continues to improve the case design that aligns with phone innovations.Usually, I don\u2019t gravitate towards colorful cases but the rosemarine/plum haze color is fun and not overbearing.  I also enjoy the color combination with my rose gold iPhone 7 Plus and feel that it compliments it.  The case comes in 3 pieces and is easy to put together.  The inner layer consists of two hard plastic pieces that snap around the case, one side includes the screen protector.  The outer shell is a rubbery flexible material that covers the area where the inner pieces connect and add extra protection.I\u2019m very impressed with the screen protection with this Otterbox.  In my opinion, the screen protector feels better than using the solo film screen protectors.  Not better than glass, but I have the luck of breaking glass ones after a couple of days.  The screen protector also doesn\u2019t have the annoying bubbles and doesn\u2019t cling to a speck of dust.  The only parts of the phone that are consistently exposed are the speakers and the cameras.  The buttons are covered and are fully functional without difficulty.  The lightning port and the switch to set your iPhone 7 Plus to silent are covered with the rubber but you can open them.The only downfall I used to have with the Otterbox was the size.  Now that the iPhone 7 Plus is much slimmer I feel the case is a better fit.  I can\u2019t use the Otterbox with my lightning dock but not many cases on my phone allow me to use it anyway.Overall, the Otterbox Defender for the iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent choice for people with an active lifestyle or professions that put your phone at risk for damage.  The Otterbox is one of those cases that if I were to drop my phone I wouldn\u2019t gasp and cringe in fear because I know it\u2019s thoroughly protected.",
            "I had just bought a new iPhone 7 Plus and I wanted a good case for protective purposes. In the past there had always been occasions when somehow, no matter how careful I was, I managed to drop my cellular phones. In addition, not only did I drop it, but I somehow always managed to drop it onto either a concrete or asphalt surface. At least 2 cell phones I had broken that way, so I was looking for a case that featured \"protection\" as the primary functionality feature of the case I bought. This time, I decided I was not going to make the same mistake again. Thus, I did a search for highly protective iPhone 7 plus compatible cases.Amazon has a huge collection of cases, even ones that are protective. Some even use special military grade plastics. Yet I wanted one that would allow easy access to all the features of my cell phone. This one achieves those objectives, without creating any barriers to access of all my new phone's features. Thus, I chose this one which did everything on my list of requirements.The best results and comments I can make about this \"Otterbox Defender Series Case\" is the following:  1). Installation is trivial and simple  2). Access to every feature and button is easy  3)  AND, the case is very PROTECTIVE!!!How do I know? Because within 48 hours of my installation I was getting out of my car, when I dropped it on the cement parking lot. So, I said to myself, \"Well, that is why I bought this one, so let's see if it is still working.And, Voila, every single function and button still worked. Nothing was damaged, and it greeted me immediately with perfect functionality! In addition, since that time I have dropped the phone 3 more times. Once on my hardwood floor, once on my asphalt parking lot driveway and once again on the concrete slab of my garage and every time it worked perfectly.Note please that all the drops were from an altitude of approximately waist high, therefore about 3 to 4 feet from impact. I decided that in every respect, this Otterbox Defender Series case was a perfect selection for meeting all my criteria. However, I would not attempt to find the limits of its protection. Thus, I do not recommend high altitude drops or throwing the phone and case to the concrete, but for normal use, including accidental drops this product fits the bill in every respect (I did not test for water) and thus I was totally satisfied and gave this product a well earned 5 Star rating. If good accidental drop protection is what you need, then I strongly recommend this product!",
            "The case goes on and comes off easy, dropped more than once on pavement(butterfingers) phone protected. Only two things I dont like about it are the plastic screen protector that it comes with already attached, terrible, zero protection from anything but dust, Last couple of these for other phones I just took the plastic off and the glue that attaches it and got the glass screen protector that I know offers real protection from minor impacts. The second thing is not a big deal but I figured  I\u2019d mention it, the case does increase the size of the already big phone slightly, the otterbox commuter case is thinner but I like the all rubber exterior of this one over the mostly hard plastic case of the commuter whch I also owned, the all rubber just makes the grip much more secure in your hand. Both cases offer superior protection in my opinion.",
            "What the hell is the point of getting a NEW defender case when it comes completely smeared?! This will be the second one I\u2019ve purchased the first one was fine this one looks like it fell out at the warehouse and dirty fingerprints are all over it.",
            "UPDATE- Very disappointed in otter box quality of this case. I may have received a weak and defective product. The white plastic part of the case has snapped inside the soft cover. People use these cases on construction sites with no problems. I go to school, work, and home. There should be no reason why my case has broken after 2 months of me having it. The rest of the case is in perfect condidtion. Also another downside to this open part at the top of the phone is I have to open the case to clean lint and debris from the screen every couple of weeks. That whole also lets water through so if I forget to flip the phone over while I\u2019m at the sink I have to clean water out of the case(which is how I found this break)Very pretty medium dark teal with white shell looks great on my black phone. Fit is sleek at a little under a dimes width for thickness. Durability fantastic obviously otter box is know for being one of the best for protection. The dad clip I\u2019ll admit I use. It helps my small hands hold onto this huge phone kind of like a popsocket would. The clip is also the perfect size to fit in my car door cup holder so I can use my phone for gps. Case does not obstruct the sound quality. Dislikes- although the screen protector does protect my screen from scratches it doesn\u2019t not stop debris from getting in the case. I did not want to have a built in screen protector. I wanted tempered glass but every case with this level of fall protection has a built in protector. I also don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t have the apple logo centered in the circle in the back.I am afraid that this rubber part will start to warp and loosen. Will update with progress of that aspect.",
            "I have been a otter box fan/ user since they came out, all my cells have had them. I just upgraded my phone and i got my case in the mail. I have never experienced almost having to slam my finger down on my screen to be able to text or unlock it. the screen cover has made it almost impossible to use my phone without slamming the screen. I am so disappointed right now with this case.",
            "This is a great case, but you have to remove the built-in screen protector. The gap between the protector and your phone\u2019s glass is insane \u2014 you have to press so much harder just to initiate a tap on your phone. AND it\u2019s loud! It sounds like you\u2019re tap dancing when you text someone.Solution: Remove the built-in protector. Grab a knife and start cutting it out, get rid of it, and apply one of those adhesive high-impact glass screen protectors before you put the case on. Much better."

            "I have had this protector as I feel it is was necessary to get it for my iPhone 8 plus. Being a recent convert from a Samsung Galaxy 5, I could no longer feel comfortable being responsibly gentle with an even larger and significantly heavier phone, so I looked for a case that wasn't too bulky, but also something that offered some protection. My first case was the Pursuit, but I felt it was too big, and the cover switch for the ringer did not work properly, so I returned it.After much research, and nearly buying a silicon case with fuzzy lining, I chose this. I went back to it because it was American made, which I felt meant it may have went through a strict quality control process, and I liked the feel of the pursuit case, despite the non-functioning ringer cover switch.I am happy with this purchase, and for the face of the phone that is not covered, I feel this product works well if you have a separate glass face protector. I am usually a bigger fan of single piece protectors, but not in the instance of a case where a touch screen is involved. I am also happy that this case was not as bulky as I expected, as I had planned to get a slimmer case for formal events. To me, this provides excellent protection without being bulky.This unit went on over my phone a little tight at first, as it was activating some of the side volume buttons as it was being fitted over my iPhone 8 Plus. But once on, it felt very snug. I like that the case feels nice with semi-grippy rubber around the side, but rigid and hard along the surfaces on the back at the same time. I guess I'm a tactile sort of person because besides liking the feel of this case in hand, I have no problems placing my phone down on hard concrete (which I would be nervous about doing with iPhones bare glass exterior) and enjoy that the phone feels protected in my front (yes, front) pocket as well, from shifting and or bending.An important feature to me is that the camera 'bump' is aligned in a fitted hole that gives it and the flash an ample opening and provides what feels to be a quarter's thickness to keep the bump from touching a surface if the case is placed camera-side down.The bottom cut-outs for the lightning cable and bottom speakers holes seem perfectly aligned for me, and the side buttons for the power and the volume controls are pleasantly stiff, which are find for me since I do not use them much and value the protection they provide for the little-used buttons. I also like that the ringer on/off switch is a simple cut-out rather than an attempted addition side button. I feel that this switch is, by design, something to correctly cover and have another working switch over it, as the Pursuit attempted to do.I highly recommend this case and I think it is an excellent value on Amazon at $28 at the time of purchase. I would be willing to bet it's nearly twice as much if you buy it at your local cell phone provider.Thank you for reading and I hope this review helps you.",
            "This is the fake GARBAGE that AMAZON Fullfilment sent to me! It\u2019s a FAKE KNOCK OFF of an Otterbox branded Symmetry Series case. Amazon\u2019s is made in China. The REAL Symmetry case from Otterbox is much different looking and comes in very expensive packaging!!! Total disappointment from Amazon today!!!",
            "The item I received is NOT a true Otterbox. The box that this cheap silicone/ rubber cover came in states \u201cStylish Coice, Fashion Case\u201d with an Otterbox sticker stuck crookedly on front. The \u201ccase\u201d does not have a hard back or a raised beveled edge. I know this is fake since I\u2019ve had one for my previous iPhone and it was a wonderful product. Otterbox box was also imprinted in the case. This \u201ccover\u201d does not have Otterbox on it anywhere. Returning immediately.** Added pics. I purchased a real one from Best Buy on left. They price matched Amazon. You can see the flimsy fake in second pic and the true Otterbox in last two pics.",
            "I've had this case for almost 10 months so I think I can speak definitively about this.Look I know I'm the kind of person who drops stuff. I'm also the kind of person who likes to go out which makes me a 2x kind of person who drops stuff. So when I'm getting a case, it's a short term relationship.Not this son of a gun. Let me tell you the ways I've dropped this - off of a desk, off a ladder, accidentally threw across the street, sneezed so hard it flew out of my hands and hit the wall, angrily made hand movement and it slipped out, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on a couch, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on the floor,  dropped in a pot of water (that probably has more to do with the phones water resistance but STILL), thrown as a joke, thrown as not a joke, adamant gesticulation, demonstrating how hard my brother's head was by hitting him with it (would not recommend), trying to impress girlfriend, dropped every day.Seriously, as someone who drops their phone both intentionally and unintentionally, I cannot recommend this case enough. Also it looks good, I love the color, it's light and is the slimmest case that will still protect your phone to a degree that you legitimately don't have to worry about it if you're a class A phone dropper.",
            "Case seems to protect the phone well enough but it scratches very easily and the scratches make it very slippery and hard to hold. After only having the case for a short time it already looks terrible. Not a good design, next time I\u2019ll be going with something other than OtterBox.",
            "Terrible...I always trust otter box with my phones. This case however let me down. It is really pretty but pretty poor quality. The back got scratched from just placing it on a table, and not to mention the color transfer from any clothing item you wear. I\u2019m disappointed I paid so much money for this disappointing case \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",
            "Did not protect the back of my phone from breaking.  My phone was in my coat pocket and I was bent down getting something from the floor of my car when my phone slipped out of my pocket and fell to the driveway. I didn\u2019t even cringe, it was such a small distance and didn\u2019t sound like a hard fall. Very shocked to see the cracks across the back. Ive trusted in this brand for years and was very disappointed!",
            "I give one star because I can\u2019t give a 0... In the features says STAY- CLEAR / ANTI-YELLOWING, one of the main reasons I bought it. But after a week using it it\u2019s horrible. Looks like it\u2019s 2 colors! All the edge it\u2019s yellow, looks dirty. DONT BUY IT !",
            "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It is very protective yet fashionable. She\u2019s dropped her phone multiple times from pretty high with his case on and her phone stayed safe; the case did not take any damage either. It came in the nice packaging and also came with a warranty. (The white splotches seen on the case in the photos are just from the flash.) I hope this review helps! \ud83d\ude04",
            "Ugh I had high hopes for this one, but I dropped my phone twice..and not from a skyscraper.. from less than 3 feet and both times my glass protector cracked.. thankfully I had the protector on it, but I have had the same screen protector on my phone since December ($40) and have dropped it many times without a scratch.. but since this case doesn\u2019t actually cover the phone.. the phone touches the ground first instead of the case.. and that\u2019s why it cracked it.. I went back to the other series and so far so good..Another thing ..the phone is hella slippery when your trying to use it.. no grip what so ever ..The only thing I liked was that I could use the Apple mirror in the back since it was see through"

            "I\u2019m 5\u20197 / 125lbs / 27inch waist. I got the XS size. The color shirts I got were Black,Dark Blue,White. I can understand why maybe other buyers didn\u2019t like these shirts due to the material perhaps not being the best but listen this shirts are good! They get the job done, they look stylish! I guess my only wish was that this shirts were a little bit slimmer from the waist but hey maybe it\u2019s probably me who needs to grow more lol anyways I would buy these again if I have to, I\u2019ll wait untill my 3 shirts ware out and most likely purchase them again &amp; try different colors. I hope my review helps you.",
            "The shirts are absolutely great and have a great look but they aren't as stretchy as some other brands. However, the price for the three of them is definitely a steal! I'm in a stage in my life where I can juggle between a medium and a large because of my physique and my height but I definitely ordered a size too small. Medium size isn't a bad fit but I should've gone with the large option. If you know for a fact that you are a certain size then definitely choose that option but if you also struggle with being able to juggle between two different sizes, choose the larger option. As for quality of the material, they have been doing well so far and I don't expect any tears in these any time soon but if they do (keep in mind this could also be due to the fact that I ordered a size smaller), I will definitely update this review as I'm sure any one person would want to have workout shirts last.",
            "I'm only 5'10\" 169lbs this shirt fits really well. I like the way it sits on the shoulders and it allows my body to breath while working out.",
            "The package came on time ..it fit me perfectly ..I am a guy with 5\u20196 and 152lb ...I ordered large as I like little loose ...overall I am very much impressed with this tank top ...let see how it will be after a wash..till now I am fully satisfied with price and quality.",
            "These three tanks tops are a great deal for the price! I love the texture and feel of them. The medium size fit me well, these do run slightly big as I typically wear a large in T-Shirts and tank tops. For your reference, I am 5-10 ~170lbs.If I had one complaint, it would be that the cut at the front of the tank hangs pretty low, as in deep down your chest. This is more of a style thing, but I would have preferred it a little bit higher. Otherwise, great tanks so far. Can't lose at that price",
            "I bought a medium and it shows my muscles perfectly.  I wear them mostly on back day to show off my lats. Not dry fit but still worth the purchase. The material is like a thin jersey but we'll made. I will buy more colors soon.",
            "Best tanks ever.  Literally wear them everyday to, gym or for a run or even just out. Lightweight material (like a sports jersey material) with plenty of holes for air travel.  Initially purchased a three pack in L and wanted to see if they fit as expected and wanted to see the quality of the material.  Size fit as expected.  I'm 5'10 and 185 pounds.  I usually wear a large T-Shirts and sometimes a med 15 1/2 fitted dress shirt.  Tanks fit great without being too tight or too loose.  Loved them so much, I bought a second three pack in different colors.  I've washed them several times so far in cold water and haven't had any problems with shrinking, color fading, or fraying.  For this price, highly recommend.",
            "I am 6'3 and about 155 lbs, so its always a struggle to find clothes that fit well. I bought the SMALLS because I wanted them to fit snugger on me than on the model in the pic, and I thought they looked long enough on the model in the pic to where a SMALL would still fit me.Turns out, I was correct. They fit me well. The back of the shirts are slightly longer than the front (just a note). I like that they fit me in a more form fitting (but not tight or anything) way.Keep in mind that these shirts are kind of mesh-like, although I don't think anything is too visible through them.The material is not made of cotton so they will not shrink in the washer, etc.I bought the triple black pack, would buy again.",
            "The red, blue and yellow 2xl tanks showed up as expected.  Stitching looks good, color looks good, and laying them out they look consistent in size. 2xl size was measured at 30.5 inches length, 25.5 inches at the waist, and 25 inches just under the arm pits.  Me... I am 5\u201910\u201d athletic stocky build ranging from 225 to 245.  Today... 245.  Chest measurement is 46 inch unflexed. I range between 46 and 48 suit coat... 48 right now.  At 225 my belly button measurement is around 37\u201d.  Now... we\u2019ll... not 37.  But still smaller than my chest so the shirt still works well.Took the yellow through a back wo test run.  The shirt fit well, no tugging, no restrictions and fit well.  The shirt wasn\u2019t stretched with normal stance. The shirt is very light and works well.  Then took it through cardio wo that the mesh did its job not absorbing a bunch of sweat.I prefer cotton tanks over all the sheer nylon tanks out there due to the fit. These tanks are a great option for workouts without having a soaked cotton tank.Great price.  I would recommend giving them a try.",
            "Great workout shirt.  I'm 6'2, 240 and I ordered a XXL.  Fits perfect.  It does have the feel of a jersey and appears to be stitched together very well and the length is just right.  Gives me total freedom of movement when working out."

            "I ordered a two-pack of these Slim Fit t-shirts and a two-pack of the Regular Fit t-shirts to compare and contrast. Both styles are made of the same thick cotton knit fabric, which is soft and substantial, but the fits are definitely different. These Slim Fit shirts are significantly tighter fitting in the stomach, arms, and chest area(s). The Regular Fit shirts are much looser in all three of these areas, especially the arms.Compared to a Regular Fit I would categorize these as a Slim Fit not, a Snug Fit; they fit close to the body but not tightly enough to show something like muscle definition, if that's what you're looking for.For comparison, I would say that these  Amazon Essentials Slim Fit t-shirts are tighter fitting than a standard Gap or Old Navy t-shirt fit but looser fitting than a standard American Apparel or H&amp;M t-shirt fit.Overall the quality is nice, with minimal fading and only very minor shrinkage after laundering in cold water and putting in a medium dryer. Recommended if you like a close fitting, thick cotton t-shirt.",
            "I bought both medium and large to check for best fit. Before washing, medium fit the best and large was a bit too big. After washing, the medium becomes too small and the large fits better.",
            "As someone who's pushing 6'3\" and 175lbs (most of that being around the mid-region), I was really debating between getting this shirt in large or the regular/loose fit in a medium. So I got both! And if I'm being honest, there wasn't very much of a difference. While this shirt in a medium (which I also bought) did feel tight, the large met with my broad shoulders perfectly and didn't get too slim as it went down along my chest and stomach (though the advertising photo makes it look like it totally just becomes a \"V\" towards the crotch). The regular-fit medium had a very similar fit, but was about a half inch shorter in vertical length and an inch shorter across the shoulders. Though it didn't slim as it went down like the slim-fit large, it's already shorter width made it feel like a tighter fit. Weird, right?? I tried on both shirts again and again, both before and after a single wash/dry, trying to point out all the differences before I came here to write about it here. All in all, I'm probably going to keep the slim-fit large as it actually has the shoulder length I like while not staying that length all the way down and giving off a total box-y fit. The slim-fit medium was just too small and the regular-fit medium was just a little too narrow, though I believe a regular-fit large would probably be too wide. One complaint of all the shirts that I'll have is that after a wash/dry, the hems at the bottom of the shirt did begin to curl up a bit, which is disappointing because it looks cheap (which I know it is, but other people don't). But other than that, I didn't detect any shrinkage and that's a huge plus given the price.",
            "One of the shirts was just as expected; the other one had two different sleeve sizes. The left sleeve is wayyy smaller than the right (and the other shirts sleeves) to the point that it hugs my arm while the other hangs loose.",
            "Not sure why these were called slim fit. This is definitely a regular fit shirt. This is one of the few times an Amazon product has disappointed me. It's a decent regular fit shirt, but just call it what it is.",
            "The material of the shirts feel really good but they are way to small.I wear a 2XL, the shirts fit like an XL and after washing they turn into a Large, at this point I can not get the shirt on.",
            "I am 5'10\" 150lbs, with some muscle from strength training. I washed in cold water and dried on low heat before trying the shirt on for the first time and it fits perfect. Please keep these in stock in manly colors and white, thank you.",
            "To loosely quote Mitch Hedberg, \"The shirt feels like a really weak man is choking you\".My biggest complaint is the neck.  It's so small and uncomfortably tight on your neck.  Really the whole shirt fits odd, but the neck is the real problem.  The actual shirt material is fine.  I tossed this shirt pretty early into me having it.Try again Amazon.  Find a better pattern.",
            "You can't go wrong with these.  The fabric is soft and the sleeves and torso seem to have a little more intentional length added to them--both plusses in my book for a casual t-shirt.  I ordered a medium and, with about a 16.5'' neck, the rim of the collar comes right up to my neckline--fine for me but might perhaps be a potential warning for guys who are a little more husky or athletic.  I personally love them and will be buying again.",
            "I think if XS had been available it would have fit perfectly but I knew it would be a little large for me so I\u2019m not disappointed. It was precisely the shirt I needed for this cosplay! I\u2019m very picky about getting colors right and this one came the exact color as seen. It\u2019s also nice to get two in case one gets a stain while at convention! It\u2019s a very comfortable shirt and doesn\u2019t hug my chest. Tucking the front in my belt provided the exact look I was trying to duplicate. It\u2019s a great product! And I\u2019ll definitely wear these beyond cosplay!"

            "I'm a woman and I bought these to wear as everyday white tees. All the reviews I saw were written by men, so I thought I'd offer my two cents.Despite what some reviewers have said, the shirts I received are definitely see-through \u2013 I tried one on without a bra and everything was very visible, even in low light. That said, they're NOT that heavy, stiff fabric so many men's shirts are made of, and they feel well-made. I machine-wash and hang-dry them, and they're holding up very well.I normally wear a 34C, a women's small or medium top and size 4 dress. I ordered size small and they fit ... not exactly tight, but not really drapey. If you're looking for a looser, more tuckable fit, you should probably match your chest measurement to the size chart and then go up one size.",
            "These shirts fit great when I first got them.  I bought a 2 different kind of Hanes t shirts.  These shirts are made of thin 100% cotton and have a black printed label on the inside that says Comfort Soft.  After washing on warm and  drying on warm in the dryer they have shrunk at least 2 to 3 inches in lenght and no longer fit good because they are too short.  The other Hanes t shirts that I bought are made of a heavier 100% cotton and have a red printed label that says \u201c Hanes Our Most Comfortable\u201d. I would rate those shirts with 5 stars",
            "This was one of the first that popped up in my search white T-shirts and had a way better price than anything I could find in stores.  I went to Kohl's looking for something similar and they wanted to charge about 10$ per shirt!  I thought that was so ludicrous.  Anyway, these fit me perfectly.  I am average build, wider in the shoulders than I am in the waist - most of the time ;) - and after several wears, the color has remained very white.  I'm expecting them to hold up for a long time.",
            "Holy mackerel are these cheap. And terrible. For me, the first consideration is how the collar wears: it\u2019s the only part that anyone can see. After a single wash (and before I wore it once), the collar looks slightly worn, like a T-shirt that I\u2019ve had for a year. The fabric is thin - not breathes well, cozy thin, but cheap and won\u2019t last long thin. And the fabric isn\u2019t that soft. It\u2019s already a little rough. I could hope that after a few washings it would soften up, but honestly, I don\u2019t think this shirt will last that long. Hanes clearly tries to squeeze as much profit out of this shirt - and to be fair it\u2019s a super cheap shirt - but this is unacceptable.",
            "I bought these to wear underneath my white button-up shirts, and they are great. The fabric is soft and light (but not too thin) and the collar is high enough that you can't see it through a lighter button-up shirt while wearing a tie. Not to mention, they are long enough that they're not going to come untucked easily -- which is one of the main things that I was looking for (I have short undershirts). I would definitely recommend these as very good undershrts.",
            "Horrible product. I washed them before wearing and not only did they shrink and become misshapen, but one t shirt has holes already. Seems like a knockoff of the actual quality product.",
            "I have bought these like three times.  The first two times they were great. Thin, snug and fit as a perfect undershirt.  The collar held up well, the ones from a year ago still do.  BUT!  The 3 pack I bought about a month ago....fit a lil tighter (which was fine), but after wearing the t-shirt like two times each (wear, wash, wear) the collar was all stretched out and saggy....on ALL THREE SHIRTS!  Why? I don't know.  Different cut, vendor....but buy at your own risk.  I already threw the three new ones away, yet still have the ones from a year ago.",
            "I am still on a quest for cotton undershirts that feature a few things:1. Do not shrink (some minor shrinking is normal)2. The collar does not sag3. The material is not rough4. The shirt is not see-throughThese shirts are literally garbage.  I got them and put them in the wash.  They dropped by over a full size as they become rough as sand paper, and the collars, even before I tried to wear them the first time just collapsed.  Plus you can see right through them even before you wash them.",
            "I had previously gotten Hanes \"Our Most Comfortable\" t-shirts for my husband. I thought these would be the same. NOT. The material, although still 100% cotton is almost scratchy. I washed these before wearing, and now I am on the lookout to find replacements. Apparently Hanes no longer makes the ones we have previously had. Very disappointed.",
            "Arrived on time, and not damaged. Nice shirts, a bit thinner than the previous Hanes undershirts I've had in the past. They've held up well in the wash, no shrinking. Despite them being thinner, they are comfortable to wear, and I have worn them around the house like I did my previous undershirts. Too early to tell how long they will last, but if there are any longevity issues I'll report back here."

            "\u00a0I purchased this case for an iPhone 8 Plus. The first case Amazon sent lifts in the center causing a gap between the screen and the phone. I called OtterBox and filed a complaint. They said exchange the case with Amazon cause it's been less than 30 days. Amazon quickly sent me a second case. The second case had the exact same problem suggesting the new iPhone 8 Plus Defender Case may have quality control problems. Take a look at the photo I included with this review. The point where the plastic is connected to the case is lower on the bottom and the top then it is in the middle. The video shows the same anomaly - pressing on the screen causes the case to bend resulting in missed keypresses and harder contact. I am a huge fan of OtterBox Defender cases and my previous iPhone 6 case does NOT have this defect.UPDATED 9/26/17 - Per OtterBox's response to my review, I called Customer Service for a replacement case. A representative named Ariel took my call, looked up my incident number, and offered to help. I explained the issue with the case and OtterBox's response to my review. Ariel apologized for the defect and placed me on hold to speak with a Supervisor. Upon return, Ariel offered to complete a Warranty exchange for a new case to be sent out. I said that sounds good until Ariel asked me to pay $4.99 for Shipping and Handling. I said, let me get this straight, I ordered a new case through Amazon and it arrived defective. I replaced the case through Amazon and the second one is also defective. OtterBox invited me to call Customer Service for a replacement case and now I need to pay an additional $4.99 to have a working case sent to me by OtterBox. Clearly, OtterBox has given up on Quality Control AND on Customer Service.DO NOT BUY THIS CASE UNTIL OTTERBOX PROVIDES A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE!!!!UPDATED 10/5/17 - The replacement case finally arrived via FedEx SmartPost. The screen protector is perfectly attached to the side of the shell and there doesn't appear to be any gap between the screen and the phone. This suggests the first release of iPhone 8+ cases likely had a manufacturing defect which was corrected in stock sent to OtterBox. Check your case for screen protector alignment issues before the Amazon return policy expires and if you do need to go through OtterBox for a warranty exchange, expect to pay for shipping and handling.",
            "If you want ultimate protection, this is the case for you. But if want a case to show how slim your new iPhone is, look elsewhere. To give you an idea on the thickness, on the back around the Apple logo and camera is about a quarter inch of protection. Again, great case, small hands beware.",
            "I\u2019ve used OtterBox in the past and sometimes felt it was beyond the protection I needed.  The cases have always been made sturdy, easy to put together, and built to last.  The OtterBox remains one of the leading brands for phone case protection and I feel the brand continues to improve the case design that aligns with phone innovations.Usually, I don\u2019t gravitate towards colorful cases but the rosemarine/plum haze color is fun and not overbearing.  I also enjoy the color combination with my rose gold iPhone 7 Plus and feel that it compliments it.  The case comes in 3 pieces and is easy to put together.  The inner layer consists of two hard plastic pieces that snap around the case, one side includes the screen protector.  The outer shell is a rubbery flexible material that covers the area where the inner pieces connect and add extra protection.I\u2019m very impressed with the screen protection with this Otterbox.  In my opinion, the screen protector feels better than using the solo film screen protectors.  Not better than glass, but I have the luck of breaking glass ones after a couple of days.  The screen protector also doesn\u2019t have the annoying bubbles and doesn\u2019t cling to a speck of dust.  The only parts of the phone that are consistently exposed are the speakers and the cameras.  The buttons are covered and are fully functional without difficulty.  The lightning port and the switch to set your iPhone 7 Plus to silent are covered with the rubber but you can open them.The only downfall I used to have with the Otterbox was the size.  Now that the iPhone 7 Plus is much slimmer I feel the case is a better fit.  I can\u2019t use the Otterbox with my lightning dock but not many cases on my phone allow me to use it anyway.Overall, the Otterbox Defender for the iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent choice for people with an active lifestyle or professions that put your phone at risk for damage.  The Otterbox is one of those cases that if I were to drop my phone I wouldn\u2019t gasp and cringe in fear because I know it\u2019s thoroughly protected.",
            "I had just bought a new iPhone 7 Plus and I wanted a good case for protective purposes. In the past there had always been occasions when somehow, no matter how careful I was, I managed to drop my cellular phones. In addition, not only did I drop it, but I somehow always managed to drop it onto either a concrete or asphalt surface. At least 2 cell phones I had broken that way, so I was looking for a case that featured \"protection\" as the primary functionality feature of the case I bought. This time, I decided I was not going to make the same mistake again. Thus, I did a search for highly protective iPhone 7 plus compatible cases.Amazon has a huge collection of cases, even ones that are protective. Some even use special military grade plastics. Yet I wanted one that would allow easy access to all the features of my cell phone. This one achieves those objectives, without creating any barriers to access of all my new phone's features. Thus, I chose this one which did everything on my list of requirements.The best results and comments I can make about this \"Otterbox Defender Series Case\" is the following:  1). Installation is trivial and simple  2). Access to every feature and button is easy  3)  AND, the case is very PROTECTIVE!!!How do I know? Because within 48 hours of my installation I was getting out of my car, when I dropped it on the cement parking lot. So, I said to myself, \"Well, that is why I bought this one, so let's see if it is still working.And, Voila, every single function and button still worked. Nothing was damaged, and it greeted me immediately with perfect functionality! In addition, since that time I have dropped the phone 3 more times. Once on my hardwood floor, once on my asphalt parking lot driveway and once again on the concrete slab of my garage and every time it worked perfectly.Note please that all the drops were from an altitude of approximately waist high, therefore about 3 to 4 feet from impact. I decided that in every respect, this Otterbox Defender Series case was a perfect selection for meeting all my criteria. However, I would not attempt to find the limits of its protection. Thus, I do not recommend high altitude drops or throwing the phone and case to the concrete, but for normal use, including accidental drops this product fits the bill in every respect (I did not test for water) and thus I was totally satisfied and gave this product a well earned 5 Star rating. If good accidental drop protection is what you need, then I strongly recommend this product!",
            "The case goes on and comes off easy, dropped more than once on pavement(butterfingers) phone protected. Only two things I dont like about it are the plastic screen protector that it comes with already attached, terrible, zero protection from anything but dust, Last couple of these for other phones I just took the plastic off and the glue that attaches it and got the glass screen protector that I know offers real protection from minor impacts. The second thing is not a big deal but I figured  I\u2019d mention it, the case does increase the size of the already big phone slightly, the otterbox commuter case is thinner but I like the all rubber exterior of this one over the mostly hard plastic case of the commuter whch I also owned, the all rubber just makes the grip much more secure in your hand. Both cases offer superior protection in my opinion.",
            "What the hell is the point of getting a NEW defender case when it comes completely smeared?! This will be the second one I\u2019ve purchased the first one was fine this one looks like it fell out at the warehouse and dirty fingerprints are all over it.",
            "UPDATE- Very disappointed in otter box quality of this case. I may have received a weak and defective product. The white plastic part of the case has snapped inside the soft cover. People use these cases on construction sites with no problems. I go to school, work, and home. There should be no reason why my case has broken after 2 months of me having it. The rest of the case is in perfect condidtion. Also another downside to this open part at the top of the phone is I have to open the case to clean lint and debris from the screen every couple of weeks. That whole also lets water through so if I forget to flip the phone over while I\u2019m at the sink I have to clean water out of the case(which is how I found this break)Very pretty medium dark teal with white shell looks great on my black phone. Fit is sleek at a little under a dimes width for thickness. Durability fantastic obviously otter box is know for being one of the best for protection. The dad clip I\u2019ll admit I use. It helps my small hands hold onto this huge phone kind of like a popsocket would. The clip is also the perfect size to fit in my car door cup holder so I can use my phone for gps. Case does not obstruct the sound quality. Dislikes- although the screen protector does protect my screen from scratches it doesn\u2019t not stop debris from getting in the case. I did not want to have a built in screen protector. I wanted tempered glass but every case with this level of fall protection has a built in protector. I also don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t have the apple logo centered in the circle in the back.I am afraid that this rubber part will start to warp and loosen. Will update with progress of that aspect.",
            "I have been a otter box fan/ user since they came out, all my cells have had them. I just upgraded my phone and i got my case in the mail. I have never experienced almost having to slam my finger down on my screen to be able to text or unlock it. the screen cover has made it almost impossible to use my phone without slamming the screen. I am so disappointed right now with this case.",
            "This is a great case, but you have to remove the built-in screen protector. The gap between the protector and your phone\u2019s glass is insane \u2014 you have to press so much harder just to initiate a tap on your phone. AND it\u2019s loud! It sounds like you\u2019re tap dancing when you text someone.Solution: Remove the built-in protector. Grab a knife and start cutting it out, get rid of it, and apply one of those adhesive high-impact glass screen protectors before you put the case on. Much better."

            "Highly recommend this product, purchased this for my wife 2 weeks ago along with the iPhone X. Also had a tempered glass screen protector on it...anyways, I dropped her off at the front door of the house today and after she closed the door she accidentally dropped the phone and it of course landed under the back tire of the car. Unknowingly I proceeded to drive to park and run over it! Thankfully it was perfectly fine! The screen protector however didn\u2019t get so lucky. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the performance of this case! Recommend to everyone! -Rebeca\u2019s husband",
            "Doesn't fit properly on my iPhone Xs. The rubber buckles around the buttons. It is real loose the volume and on and off button. This case does not fit properly, the edges are exposed and flimsy. I\u2019d be worried if I drop it. This is not for iPhone Xs. I am hugely disappointed. Openings at the bottom for mike is bigger than required (looks like they sent the cover for iPhone Xs). Camera and apple logo on the back of the phone do not properly fit at the center of the openings.  This is a huge disappointment since its a costly cover then it should fit in the iPhone Xs.",
            "This case is great! Sleek but feels protective. It has a \"lip\" that goes over the phone screen so if you drop it, the case hits the ground first and not the screen. I had no issues with it not fitting as previous reviewers mentioned, this one fits perfectly over the X with no bulges or button alignment issues.I've used the Commuter Otterbox for every previous iPhone I owned and they were always great, so I hope this one continues to work just as well!",
            "I bought this case because I had the same one for my iPhone 6s and it worked with a new baby so well. My baby would throw it and drop it all the time and nothing ever happened. For years I didn\u2019t have one crack.  I got the new iphone XS two weeks ago and just a few days into using this case the screen is cracked. You can tell that this case isn\u2019t as good as the older version of the same model because it doesn\u2019t come up as high around the sides of the screen so it can\u2019t provide as much protection. I\u2019m not sure why otter box changed their design for the commuter but I am returning this and paying to get my screen fixed :(((((",
            "Pros\u2022 Slim but provides the perfect protection to your iPhone X.\u2022 Two layers case.\u2022 Hole in the back for the ones who like to show off the Apple logo.\u2022 Feels good in your hands with a great grip.\u2022 Even if your phone has a tempered glass, thanks to its raised beveled edge, it will keep the screen safe if the phone fell on a flat surface.\u2022 Provides great protection to your back camera thanks to the raised beveled edge.\u2022 The buttons are very responsive.\u2022 Protects your lighting port against dust and debris, thanks to a nice cap.\u2022 Wireless charger friendly, I am using a Choetech.Cons\u2022 Might slip on some hard surface.",
            "Overview: This case has protected my iPhone X from numerous drops.Pros:  I'm not an overtly clumsy person.  But for some reason I feel like I need to drop my $1,000 phone onto the ground from waist to chest height.  Not a single scratch has appeared from the numerous drops.Cons:  The reason I keep dropping my phone is the hard outer shell is super slick.  Imagine dipping your hands into olive oil and then picking up your phone.  That is how slick this case is.  There is no texture to the outer shell.  You will accidentally drop your phone with this case...numerous times.  The good news is, it is awesome at protecting the phone from the inevitable drops.",
            "I do not believe this is a legit Otterbox, or the quality of Otterbox has changed. With all my previous Otterbox cases the two part system has worked really well and both layers feel of quality. This case has a cheap rubber that is not flexible as they have been before and and doesn\u2019t fit like a glove. The plastic is lacking the support to keep the rubber tightly against the phone especially on the top half of the phone.",
            "I bought the symmetry case clear and it was scratched up in a week. This case has more protection and is just as slim! Weighs more yes, but it\u2019s worth it. 1,000 dollar phone deserves this case. Don\u2019t be cheap!  Plus you get the opening in the back for the Apple LogoWorks with WIRELESS CHARGING TOO",
            "I got this for my new iPhone Xs as I loved the Commuter case on my previous iPhone 7.  Overall I did not feel like this case fit the phone well. Not sure if this is an issue with the Xs or just the overall design of the case.  The rubber portion felt loose and spongy, especially around the side button and camera while the outer plastic piece felt like it was too small and never felt completely secure over the rubber.  Things just didn't line up or look tidy.I just ordered and received the Otterbox Symmetry Case which feels perfect on my phone.  Seems like a much more secure fit and doesn't seem to sacrifice anything on protection.  Love Otterbox and their products, but the Commuter on the iPhone Xs is a \"miss\" for me",
            "I was really excited to get this case but disappointed when I got it. I have always had a Defender case and this doesn\u2019t feel as safe as I\u2019m used to. There is only rubber on the inside and slightly on the edges so I doesn\u2019t grip that well when holding or using on the side. Also there is no clear protector for the circle in the back which is what made me decide to return it. Great case for someone who is careful with their phone just not someone who wants to feel protected."

Only two things I dont like about it are the plastic screen protector that it comes with already attached, terrible, zero protection from anything but dust, Last couple of these for other phones I just took the plastic off and the glue that attaches it and got the glass screen protector that I know offers real protection from minor impacts. The second thing is not a big deal but I figured  I\u2019d mention it, the case does increase the size of the already big phone slightly, the otterbox commuter case is thinner but I like the all rubber exterior of this one over the mostly hard plastic case of the commuter whch I also owned, the all rubber just makes the grip much more secure in your hand. Both cases offer superior protection in my opinion.",
            "What the hell is the point of getting a NEW defender case when it comes completely smeared?! This will be the second one I\u2019ve purchased the first one was fine this one looks like it fell out at the warehouse and dirty fingerprints are all over it.",
            "UPDATE- Very disappointed in otter box quality of this case. I may have received a weak and defective product. The white plastic part of the case has snapped inside the soft cover. People use these cases on construction sites with no problems. I go to school, work, and home. There should be no reason why my case has broken after 2 months of me having it. The rest of the case is in perfect condidtion. Also another downside to this open part at the top of the phone is I have to open the case to clean lint and debris from the screen every couple of weeks. That whole also lets water through so if I forget to flip the phone over while I\u2019m at the sink I have to clean water out of the case(which is how I found this break)Very pretty medium dark teal with white shell looks great on my black phone. Fit is sleek at a little under a dimes width for thickness. Durability fantastic obviously otter box is know for being one of the best for protection. The dad clip I\u2019ll admit I use. It helps my small hands hold onto this huge phone kind of like a popsocket would. The clip is also the perfect size to fit in my car door cup holder so I can use my phone for gps. Case does not obstruct the sound quality. Dislikes- although the screen protector does protect my screen from scratches it doesn\u2019t not stop debris from getting in the case. I did not want to have a built in screen protector. I wanted tempered glass but every case with this level of fall protection has a built in protector. I also don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t have the apple logo centered in the circle in the back.I am afraid that this rubber part will start to warp and loosen. Will update with progress of that aspect.",

I have never experienced almost having to slam my finger down on my screen to be able to text or unlock it. the screen cover has made it almost impossible to use my phone without slamming the screen. I am so disappointed right now with this case.",
            "This is a great case, but you have to remove the built-in screen protector. The gap between the protector and your phone\u2019s glass is insane \u2014 you have to press so much harder just to initiate a tap on your phone. AND it\u2019s loud! It sounds like you\u2019re tap dancing when you text someone.Solution: Remove the built-in protector. Grab a knife and start cutting it out, get rid of it, and apply one of those adhesive high-impact glass screen protectors before you put the case on. Much better."

            "When this shirt arrived, I put it on and the fit was good. However, there are certain parts about it that make it seem cheaply made to me.For one, they didn't include spare buttons like every other collared shirt I own, so if one rips off I'm just SOL.Most notably, when you get a shirt that doesn't have a button-down collar, typically that means the shirt has slots under the collar for plastic or metal collar stays, so that the collar doesn't flop around and look shitty. Well, this shirt doesn't have those.I will probably get a tiny bit of thread and sew the collar down, which is no big deal at all, it's just annoying for a brand-new shirt. Why would you even skip this part in the factory?",
            "My experience with Goodthreads products are that they are basically Target brand clothing. They are made well; they don't feel like junk, but they don't feel fancy either. However, my biggest criticism is the sizing.I'm 5'5\", athletic build, and the shirt fits VERY LOOSE. Like wow. Goodthreads manufacturer probably targets a general husky audience for their clothing line which is fine but don't call this a \"slim-fit\". It's not slim-fit, not at all.",
            "5'8\" 150lbsThe medium is WAY too big. The material is comfortable though and the arms are actually perfect compared to the small which is way too tight in the arms.The small is a very good fit. But a good 1-2 inches too long to actually wear untucked for a shorter person. It would probably be perfect for anyone over 5'10\".These pictures are of the medium size. The small is about 1-2 inches shorter. Which is still too long to wear untucked.",
            "Nice shirt. It's lightweight, but doesn't feel cheap in my opinion. I purchased a medium and I'm 6'0\" and roughly 150lbs. I'm thin (I play soccer and have that sort of tall and thin build if you can picture that) and the shirt fit great in the chest, arms, and torso. However, before washing it was a little too long. Fortunately, after washing it probably shrunk about an inch to an inch and a half in length (this was intentional on my part) which put the shirt right where I wanted it to be. People who are built like me are certainly used to having shirts fit oddly on them in one way or another, whether that be too wide, too short, or too tight. I'm somewhat of an \"inbetweener\" when it comes to sizes. Mediums can be too large sometimes, and smalls too tight or too short. Luckily this shirt fit well enough that I'll be adding this brand and cut in to my usual shopping when I search out new clothes. Overall, happy with the purchase and will be buying more patterns and colors. I'll also try and test out some of the other shirt types offered by this same brand.",
            "Quick about me: 6', 180#, slightly muscular build. J.Crew Slim fit is still fits me like a tent so I end up spending more money to get a bunch of fabric taken in...... not with this shirt. I went with a Medium. Slim fit is exactly that. Slim. Sleeve length is superb (35/36\"). Collar is comfortable when buttoned up all the way (16.5\" neck). Does not billow out when tucked in.My only con is that the shirt is not terribly long so it might not be suitable tucking in for some.",
            "Nice shirt and great fit. I got this one and the green and blue one. I like the latter better but they're both nice and a perfect fit. I'm 6' 1 around 205 lbs and I went with the L",
            "I was pleasantly surprised at the fit and quality of this shirt.  It is slim fit without being tight, and the medium fits me perfectly (I'm 6'0 and 165 lbs).  The fabric is high quality.  Easily as nice as a Banana Republic or J Crew shirt, and a lot cheaper!",
            "After 2-3 washes, the shirt developed large holes at the end one sleeve and near the front buttons.  Routinely wash lots of other shirts that have no issues.  Definitely poor quality.  Liked the style but I have other cheap shirts that have held up to years of washing with minimal wear.",
            "Shirt looks just as promised. If you're not overweight, definitely get the slim fit cut, it will look much better on you. My only minor complain is that at 5'8\", it was just a bit on the long side and I like to wear my shirts untucked with jeans. As someone with a solid build, the medium was too tight and the large was a decent fit. I just wish the shirt with a bit shorter. If you're a few inches taller than I am then I guess this won't be an issue.",
            "Love this company, I'm 6'2 weigh 210 lbs and tbis thing fits just right. I have a out 5 if there shirts and they all fit just right I get slim fit xl."

            "\u00a0I purchased this case for an iPhone 8 Plus. The first case Amazon sent lifts in the center causing a gap between the screen and the phone. I called OtterBox and filed a complaint. They said exchange the case with Amazon cause it's been less than 30 days. Amazon quickly sent me a second case. The second case had the exact same problem suggesting the new iPhone 8 Plus Defender Case may have quality control problems. Take a look at the photo I included with this review. The point where the plastic is connected to the case is lower on the bottom and the top then it is in the middle. The video shows the same anomaly - pressing on the screen causes the case to bend resulting in missed keypresses and harder contact. I am a huge fan of OtterBox Defender cases and my previous iPhone 6 case does NOT have this defect.UPDATED 9/26/17 - Per OtterBox's response to my review, I called Customer Service for a replacement case. A representative named Ariel took my call, looked up my incident number, and offered to help. I explained the issue with the case and OtterBox's response to my review. Ariel apologized for the defect and placed me on hold to speak with a Supervisor. Upon return, Ariel offered to complete a Warranty exchange for a new case to be sent out. I said that sounds good until Ariel asked me to pay $4.99 for Shipping and Handling. I said, let me get this straight, I ordered a new case through Amazon and it arrived defective. I replaced the case through Amazon and the second one is also defective. OtterBox invited me to call Customer Service for a replacement case and now I need to pay an additional $4.99 to have a working case sent to me by OtterBox. Clearly, OtterBox has given up on Quality Control AND on Customer Service.DO NOT BUY THIS CASE UNTIL OTTERBOX PROVIDES A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE!!!!UPDATED 10/5/17 - The replacement case finally arrived via FedEx SmartPost. The screen protector is perfectly attached to the side of the shell and there doesn't appear to be any gap between the screen and the phone. This suggests the first release of iPhone 8+ cases likely had a manufacturing defect which was corrected in stock sent to OtterBox. Check your case for screen protector alignment issues before the Amazon return policy expires and if you do need to go through OtterBox for a warranty exchange, expect to pay for shipping and handling.",
            "If you want ultimate protection, this is the case for you. But if want a case to show how slim your new iPhone is, look elsewhere. To give you an idea on the thickness, on the back around the Apple logo and camera is about a quarter inch of protection. Again, great case, small hands beware.",
            "I\u2019ve used OtterBox in the past and sometimes felt it was beyond the protection I needed.  The cases have always been made sturdy, easy to put together, and built to last.  The OtterBox remains one of the leading brands for phone case protection and I feel the brand continues to improve the case design that aligns with phone innovations.Usually, I don\u2019t gravitate towards colorful cases but the rosemarine/plum haze color is fun and not overbearing.  I also enjoy the color combination with my rose gold iPhone 7 Plus and feel that it compliments it.  The case comes in 3 pieces and is easy to put together.  The inner layer consists of two hard plastic pieces that snap around the case, one side includes the screen protector.  The outer shell is a rubbery flexible material that covers the area where the inner pieces connect and add extra protection.I\u2019m very impressed with the screen protection with this Otterbox.  In my opinion, the screen protector feels better than using the solo film screen protectors.  Not better than glass, but I have the luck of breaking glass ones after a couple of days.  The screen protector also doesn\u2019t have the annoying bubbles and doesn\u2019t cling to a speck of dust.  The only parts of the phone that are consistently exposed are the speakers and the cameras.  The buttons are covered and are fully functional without difficulty.  The lightning port and the switch to set your iPhone 7 Plus to silent are covered with the rubber but you can open them.The only downfall I used to have with the Otterbox was the size.  Now that the iPhone 7 Plus is much slimmer I feel the case is a better fit.  I can\u2019t use the Otterbox with my lightning dock but not many cases on my phone allow me to use it anyway.Overall, the Otterbox Defender for the iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent choice for people with an active lifestyle or professions that put your phone at risk for damage.  The Otterbox is one of those cases that if I were to drop my phone I wouldn\u2019t gasp and cringe in fear because I know it\u2019s thoroughly protected.",
            "I had just bought a new iPhone 7 Plus and I wanted a good case for protective purposes. In the past there had always been occasions when somehow, no matter how careful I was, I managed to drop my cellular phones. In addition, not only did I drop it, but I somehow always managed to drop it onto either a concrete or asphalt surface. At least 2 cell phones I had broken that way, so I was looking for a case that featured \"protection\" as the primary functionality feature of the case I bought. This time, I decided I was not going to make the same mistake again. Thus, I did a search for highly protective iPhone 7 plus compatible cases.Amazon has a huge collection of cases, even ones that are protective. Some even use special military grade plastics. Yet I wanted one that would allow easy access to all the features of my cell phone. This one achieves those objectives, without creating any barriers to access of all my new phone's features. Thus, I chose this one which did everything on my list of requirements.The best results and comments I can make about this \"Otterbox Defender Series Case\" is the following:  1). Installation is trivial and simple  2). Access to every feature and button is easy  3)  AND, the case is very PROTECTIVE!!!How do I know? Because within 48 hours of my installation I was getting out of my car, when I dropped it on the cement parking lot. So, I said to myself, \"Well, that is why I bought this one, so let's see if it is still working.And, Voila, every single function and button still worked. Nothing was damaged, and it greeted me immediately with perfect functionality! In addition, since that time I have dropped the phone 3 more times. Once on my hardwood floor, once on my asphalt parking lot driveway and once again on the concrete slab of my garage and every time it worked perfectly.Note please that all the drops were from an altitude of approximately waist high, therefore about 3 to 4 feet from impact. I decided that in every respect, this Otterbox Defender Series case was a perfect selection for meeting all my criteria. However, I would not attempt to find the limits of its protection. Thus, I do not recommend high altitude drops or throwing the phone and case to the concrete, but for normal use, including accidental drops this product fits the bill in every respect (I did not test for water) and thus I was totally satisfied and gave this product a well earned 5 Star rating. If good accidental drop protection is what you need, then I strongly recommend this product!",
            "The case goes on and comes off easy, dropped more than once on pavement(butterfingers) phone protected.

            "I'm not sure what the reviewers who are complaining that these shirts are \"too heavy\" were expecting. It says \"heavyweight\" quite clearly. Anyway, I think these are great. I bought these mainly because of the advertised no-stretch collar, and I am very happy with them. If anything, the collar is actually slightly tight! The weight is great -- they are heavy, but I prefer that to a thin, flimsy undershirt.. These definitely have more heft to them than the standard ten-in-a-pack garbage you get at WalMart. They feel like they are good quality, are warm, and the collars don't stretch. I found the 2XLT to be slightly large, so they are a little baggy, but well within the bounds of tolerance, and they are 100% cotton so they should shrink a little.As a side note, I had to contact the seller (Cali Clothing) due to a shipping issue that was not their fault, and they were very helpful. Going to order some more of these from them soon.Update, one week after buying: after washing in cold water, with low-heat tumble drying, the cotton tightened up just enough that they fit well now. The collar stayed tight and shows no sign of sagging. A+",
            "After buying Penney's Strafford 100@ heavyweight cotton for 30 + years, last year was the last time they will get my money. The so-called heavyweight were no more than a regular weight Hanes from Walmart. I found these on Amazon, ordered their last package, and son was very pleased. I will be ordering more for both sons before Christmas!",
            "I love pro club t shirts. Got to order more soon!!!!",
            "After going through the paper thin tee shirts that even the major brand name manufacturers are peddling, it's good to see that quality products like this are still available. These shirts actually exceeded my expectations, and certainly worth the extra price. There is no comparison between these shirts and those made by Fruit of The Loom or Hanes. These are vastly superior. These shirts are what the brand names used to be like before cheap price became the dominant factor. The cheaper tee shirts are simply not worth having. They were so cheaply constructed that the necks sagged from the time they were removed from the package.  I'll be ordering another package of these.",
            "I have always liked pro club t shirts and I am happy that amazon has them now. They are great shirts. What I like about them is that the neck stays flush and doesn't get loose and bacony like hanes or gilden.",
            "I'm a 5'6\", 130lb thin board of a woman with broad shoulders and I LOVE these shirts. My style is fairly androgynous, and I don't like the dainty, thin collars on most shirts for women. I really like the boxy fit and tight, wide collar on these. I also like the angular, longer sleeves. The fabric is heavyweight and durable and hangs with a bit of structure (not drape-y). &amp; of course the price is right. This is my new go-to tee.",
            "These are REALLY nice shirts. Although, they run just a tiny bit small, the overall quality by far out weighs that fact. The neck band doesn't sag like so many other brands. I bought one to try it out. LIKED it so well I bought 3 more (one size larger) and will buy more. If you consider the size and order accordingly, and want a heavy weight T, you won't be disappointed. I formally bought Stafford from JCP, but these are MUCH better. Stafford are nice but the collar will not match these. Guess it is all in what you want. They certainly won me over.",
            "Super nice, thick and heavy out of the package. I threw it on and it fit like a glove but I haven't even washed it yet and I know it's really going to shrink unless I air dry it and stretch it.Side note though, I have gained a lot of weight recently and I'm normally a M/L and have turned into a L/Xl hence the 4 star review. I'm slimming down again to fit into these, but they're nice, I reordered in an XL too so I can wear them now.",
            "Shirt was not a real pro club shirt. It was way too thin and came with no tag. Plus only one shirt came when the description says it's a 3 pack.",
            "I have been looking for heavy weight t shirts for my husband.  When I received these, I was very happy with the weight.  I wanted my husband to try them on, but being a guy, he figured they would fit just fine, so I popped them in the the wash.  The first time he put one on, I noticed that it\u2019s quit a bit shorter than his other t shirts in the same size.  Also, the neck opening is very small.  It looks like it is choking him, but he says it\u2019s fine.  If I order again, I will go up a size, for sure.  The quality is great"

            "I have had this protector as I feel it is was necessary to get it for my iPhone 8 plus. Being a recent convert from a Samsung Galaxy 5, I could no longer feel comfortable being responsibly gentle with an even larger and significantly heavier phone, so I looked for a case that wasn't too bulky, but also something that offered some protection. My first case was the Pursuit, but I felt it was too big, and the cover switch for the ringer did not work properly, so I returned it.After much research, and nearly buying a silicon case with fuzzy lining, I chose this. I went back to it because it was American made, which I felt meant it may have went through a strict quality control process, and I liked the feel of the pursuit case, despite the non-functioning ringer cover switch.I am happy with this purchase, and for the face of the phone that is not covered, I feel this product works well if you have a separate glass face protector. I am usually a bigger fan of single piece protectors, but not in the instance of a case where a touch screen is involved. I am also happy that this case was not as bulky as I expected, as I had planned to get a slimmer case for formal events. To me, this provides excellent protection without being bulky.This unit went on over my phone a little tight at first, as it was activating some of the side volume buttons as it was being fitted over my iPhone 8 Plus. But once on, it felt very snug. I like that the case feels nice with semi-grippy rubber around the side, but rigid and hard along the surfaces on the back at the same time. I guess I'm a tactile sort of person because besides liking the feel of this case in hand, I have no problems placing my phone down on hard concrete (which I would be nervous about doing with iPhones bare glass exterior) and enjoy that the phone feels protected in my front (yes, front) pocket as well, from shifting and or bending.An important feature to me is that the camera 'bump' is aligned in a fitted hole that gives it and the flash an ample opening and provides what feels to be a quarter's thickness to keep the bump from touching a surface if the case is placed camera-side down.The bottom cut-outs for the lightning cable and bottom speakers holes seem perfectly aligned for me, and the side buttons for the power and the volume controls are pleasantly stiff, which are find for me since I do not use them much and value the protection they provide for the little-used buttons. I also like that the ringer on/off switch is a simple cut-out rather than an attempted addition side button. I feel that this switch is, by design, something to correctly cover and have another working switch over it, as the Pursuit attempted to do.I highly recommend this case and I think it is an excellent value on Amazon at $28 at the time of purchase. I would be willing to bet it's nearly twice as much if you buy it at your local cell phone provider.Thank you for reading and I hope this review helps you.",
            "This is the fake GARBAGE that AMAZON Fullfilment sent to me! It\u2019s a FAKE KNOCK OFF of an Otterbox branded Symmetry Series case. Amazon\u2019s is made in China. The REAL Symmetry case from Otterbox is much different looking and comes in very expensive packaging!!! Total disappointment from Amazon today!!!",

They price matched Amazon. You can see the flimsy fake in second pic and the true Otterbox in last two pics.",
            "I've had this case for almost 10 months so I think I can speak definitively about this.Look I know I'm the kind of person who drops stuff. I'm also the kind of person who likes to go out which makes me a 2x kind of person who drops stuff. So when I'm getting a case, it's a short term relationship.Not this son of a gun. Let me tell you the ways I've dropped this - off of a desk, off a ladder, accidentally threw across the street, sneezed so hard it flew out of my hands and hit the wall, angrily made hand movement and it slipped out, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on a couch, demonstrating how good it is by throwing it on the floor,  dropped in a pot of water (that probably has more to do with the phones water resistance but STILL), thrown as a joke, thrown as not a joke, adamant gesticulation, demonstrating how hard my brother's head was by hitting him with it (would not recommend), trying to impress girlfriend, dropped every day.Seriously, as someone who drops their phone both intentionally and unintentionally, I cannot recommend this case enough. Also it looks good, I love the color, it's light and is the slimmest case that will still protect your phone to a degree that you legitimately don't have to worry about it if you're a class A phone dropper.",
            "Case seems to protect the phone well enough but it scratches very easily and the scratches make it very slippery and hard to hold. After only having the case for a short time it already looks terrible. Not a good design, next time I\u2019ll be going with something other than OtterBox.",
            "Terrible...I always trust otter box with my phones. This case however let me down. It is really pretty but pretty poor quality. The back got scratched from just placing it on a table, and not to mention the color transfer from any clothing item you wear.

My phone was in my coat pocket and I was bent down getting something from the floor of my car when my phone slipped out of my pocket and fell to the driveway. I didn\u2019t even cringe, it was such a small distance and didn\u2019t sound like a hard fall. Very shocked to see the cracks across the back. Ive trusted in this brand for years and was very disappointed!",
            "I give one star because I can\u2019t give a 0... In the features says STAY- CLEAR / ANTI-YELLOWING, one of the main reasons I bought it. But after a week using it it\u2019s horrible. Looks like it\u2019s 2 colors! All the edge it\u2019s yellow, looks dirty. DONT BUY IT !",

She\u2019s dropped her phone multiple times from pretty high with his case on and her phone stayed safe; the case did not take any damage either. It came in the nice packaging and also came with a warranty. (The white splotches seen on the case in the photos are just from the flash.) I hope this review helps! \ud83d\ude04",

I went back to the other series and so far so good..Another thing ..the phone is hella slippery when your trying to use it.. no grip what so ever ..The only thing I liked was that I could use the Apple mirror in the back since it was see through"

            "I love these shirts im 6 foot 1 and 216 lbs i bought these to wear to the gym and i love the way they fit....the material is high quality....snug but not overly tight...definitely made for an athletic type of body .....the red and white shirt I'm wearing is a Large so is the blue and white ......the grey and black shirt is an Extra Large if that's helpful",
            "So I wrote a compete and detailed review for this shirt and while I was adding pictures my internet refreshed and it's gone so I'm not doing that again sorry!This shirt is a quality purchase. The fabric feels surprisingly dense. You must purchase sizing 2-3 times your typical.I am 6'\u00b9 240 lb and this 2xl shirt fits me as a large typically would.I'm happy with his purchase and will likely purchase more of these shirts-more than likely in 3xl for the comfort.",
            "It's very long in the body, and doesn't really have a slim fit like most baseball tees.  I've got a long torso and it's still too long for me, but I'm ok with that because I like knowing my shirt slightly covers my rump. Because I've got some curve, it makes me look rather boxy. The colors are nice though, so I'm hoping I can shrink it in the wash and stretch it in places to fit better. I'm 5'7\", 142lbs, with a slightly curvy/athletic build. The arms are big enough to house my muscles, which gives it a leg up on most women's shirts. It doesn't look cheaply made, so that's another plus. If you want a good pajama shirt or you like boys clothes, this will be great for you. If you have muscular arms and a longer torso, this will be great for you. If you want it to hug your body like it does on the male models or customers who sent in pics... You might want to pass this up.",
            "Love It. Fits like I wanted. I'm 5'11'' 180lbs and I normally where a medium or a large, I got this in a large and it \"fits\" me like I want. Wife loves it too",
            "Original: Trust me these shirts are worth it. I go to sites that sell shirts like this for $30-$50 just for this kind of quality. The softness from the polyester and cotton blend is what makes this shirt worth it. I just had to get rid of all my 100% cotton shirts because they felt too rough after I started wearing these. Not even my favorite brand store have this type of quality. I at least expected Hollister or Abercrombie to match this but even if they do They charge 3 times the price (on clearance too). I recommend this shirt brand too everyone. Just make sure to get 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The blend makes a huge difference. Not 50/50, Not 70/30, a true 60/40 is the one you want. Oh I almost forgot they even gave me a discount off my next purchase and I just started buying from them. Well Guess I'll starting buying from them now. See ya Later everyone.Edit 1. Where Do I even start. I was once so proud to be a customer for this seller but now I don't know what I'm getting. I just placed an order for the exact same shirt (size, color, and quantity). I was sure they would just send another shirt my way and I just pay for it like I regularly do on Amazon. I was glad to have been able to receive a quality shirt at first but now I just received something I can't even tell. They sent me not a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt but a Shaka Active shirt which is 100% cotton. The difference in the blend is very big too me. I like my 60/40 blend because of how soft the fabric is and how much more comfort I get wearing it. The brand Dream USA makes wonderful quality shirts and I admire their products. But for the Shaka Active shirt I receive was awful. Smells strange, and I don't even know why they sent me such a hippo-size shirt. I ordered a small. fabric was rough and poorly made; nothing compare to the 60% cotton / 40% polyester one I order 2 days ago. I just don't understand why they sent me this. Was it a mistake or a mix-up? Or perhaps they are trying to get rid of past inventory of Shaka Active shirts? All I want right now is just a replacement. I'll even take a different color (size: small [60% cotton / 40% polyester]).  I will buy again only if they truly do have a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt. I do not want to buy any more lies. Please I really want to buy more shirts. Here are some photos, The shirts may look alike but the texture is very different. First set is Shaka (100%) and Second set is A Real Dream USA shirt (60% cotton / 40% polyester) I'm repeating this a lot is because I do not want anymore 100% cotton shirts.Edit 2: Okay Okay You got me. So, as I was writing this review, it turns out they listen to me then sent me a replacement on the same day. I got my new shirt and it was a Dream USA shirt. I am confident now to start buying again. I just hope this does not happen again. I am also sorry to have said anything negative. You guys working in customer service, delivery, and manufacturing have done a wonderful job. I am more than satisfied and will be buying more shirts. In fact I'll be buying 2 more shirts right now. Thank you so much for your hard work.",
            "It's always hard to guess how a shirt will fit when you buy online but I personal love this shirt. I'm 6'2, 190lbs, and I went with the XL size and it fit just how hoped the slim fit would! I have not washed it yet and hope it does not shrink otherwise it could be too small.  The quality of this shirt is great it's  very comfortable to wear, the sleeves are the perfect length and really like the navy blue color.  Definitely gonna pick up some different colors.",
            "Very soft, thin fabric with athletic fit.  I\u2019m  6\u20193 and 180lbs and normally wear a L and sometimes an XL.  Ordered XL due to warnings that shirt runs small. It fits but is just a bit tight (but wearable). Ordered a 2XL and it\u2019s perfect. I\u2019d say you need to buy 2 sizes larger than normal,  Shirt is very comfy and I like the thin fabric. This is a benefit for me, not a criticism. I hate the heavy 100% cotton shirts. That said, BE WARNED  that other colors of this shirt  have a \u201cShaka\u201d label rather than the \u201cDream\u201d label.  The Shaka shirts are 100 thick cotton and run big. Basically, there\u2019s two different manufacturers and fabrics of the shirts offered here. Color dictates whether it\u2019s a Dream shirt or Shaka shirt.  Don\u2019t like the Shaka - way too big, ill fitting and heavy cotton",

            "Made of an odd feeling material. Feels like they were shooting for Under Armor. But not sure why you would want a baseball shirt that goes under other clothes... Or fits like its painted on. Not comfortable at all.Sick and tired of these small clothes. I ordered a 3x as its typical that clothes run small now. Even so, still at least 2 sizes too small.",
            "This is the 6th one I\u2019ve bought. I absolutely love these tops. I\u2019m super self conscious about my arms so I try to cover them as much as possible but most 3/4 sleeve shirt sleeves are super loose and fall down past my elbow constantly which really bugs me. These are tighter in the arms (but not tight) and end just at the elbow. They do run long in the torso but I\u2019m tall so they\u2019re perfect! They\u2019re not super thin like you would expect for the price, they\u2019re just the perfect amount of thickness though some colors do feel thicker than others (the heather gray/Black seem the thickest). I normally wear a medium in men\u2019s tops but I order a large in these, and though they are a TEENY bit big, I think a medium would be too small."

            "I'm not sure of the value of yet another review w/1000+ reviews for these shirts. However, I'll add my two cents... These are great if you want a v-neck that stays hidden (the shirt is relatively wide V at the neck) under a dress shirt with the top button(s) unbuttoned. These are great if you want a v-neck that stays tucked in to the pants (the shirt is relatively long). These are great if you want a v-neck that fits relatively well as an undershirt (the shirt isn't tight but it is not a loose fit around the arms and torso). These are great if you want a v-neck that works well under short-sleeved shirts (the shirt has relatively short sleeves). Hope that helps...",
            "I bought these shirts in July; I now bought many more to fully replace my other well made T shirts. I said that these \"fit as expected\" because there is no \"fit entirely better than expected\" category. The manufacturer's claim of super-soft material and lack of coming untucked rang so true to me when I was reading the description for my re-order. They are so comfortable for both reasons. Again, I am replacing all my T shirts with these; my others are reasonable--hopefully someone will benefit via Goodwill--but these are just great as far as I am concerned. Note also that it takes a lot to motivate me to write a review. Parenthetically, I have benefitted greatly from Amazon reviews, so for anyone writing incisive comments, thank you.",
            "Based on the reviews, you\u2019d think white v-neck undershirts might be the most inconsistent product for sale here. Every time I go to reorder some, the model is no longer available and I have to go searching for another version. When I could not find a good Hanes ComfortSoft version to reorder, I tried this one, and I\u2019m glad I did! It\u2019s fitted in the chest and arms, which doesn\u2019t make you look like a dweeb with extra fabric hanging off. It\u2019s also long enough to comfortably tuck in without looking like a belly shirt after one wash. I\u2019m 5\u201910 and 180 lbs and the medium is perfect.",
            "Finally a shirt that fits my body shape - tall and lanky. I'm 6'1 and 155 pounds. Regular large size t shirts fit in length but are too baggy, and mediums fit in size but are not long enough. These fill both categories. Be careful washing on high heat though, some of mine have shrunk to the point that they are quite tight in my chest area, and just barely long enough to keep a button up shirt tucked in. Only negative is that the sleeves are very short, like almost a tank top. My armpit hair sticks out when just standing there, and I am not an overly hairy guy. TMI.",

            "I ordered based on many reviews saying it ran big. I ordered a Large and I'm 6'0 200lbs and it was long enough but rather tight in the body and arms. Arms were also slightly short, so I think the sizing is correct and they do not run large. It's an undershirt so could still wear it just rather uncomfortable for me. If you like your undershirts fitted maybe go a size down and I'm usually an XL.",
            "I wear these under dress shirts and short sleeve button downs.Here is why I will keep buying these year after year.1. The cut of this V-Neck does not show when I leave the top button(s) unbuttoned on my dress and short sleeve button down shirts. This is a must for more casual use of my dress shirts.2. The length is long enough that this shirt tucks into my pants and does not come out when I raise my arms or reach down to tie my shoes. It's annoying when shirts come out of my pants and need adjusting. These are longer than normal and serve that purpose.3. These shirts are just the right thickness. They are not too thin that you can see through them and they are not too thick that they bunch or show that you are wearing an undershirt.4. Buffering layer: They are also just the right thickness and softness  to a) absorb sweat and b) buffer my skin from the outer shirt.5. Price: I'm very happy about the price for this six pack. Thank you!",
            "They are cheaper than the stores, which is great. They definitely shrink - and you should know this. This is nothing new - you need to know this before you order. Order a size bigger, they will shrink a whole size. Guaranteed. You should not be mad when this happens.The problem is when someone wants to wear them as a \"t-shirt\", and not as an undershirt. Because they will be always be too long - if you get the proper size - because they are supposed to be this way.",
            "I ordered these undershirts and I received them when I was told I would receive them.  The package had no damage and was dry.  When I opened the package, the packs of under shirts were in there own packages which looked like they were taped shut.  When I removed the tape to expose the undershirts I noticed some nastiness on them.  They smelled terrible and had this dirty liquid on both of them but yet the packing and product package were \"dry\".  It was disgusting!  I added the pictures to this review.  Now I have to go out of my way to start a return process.",
            "The shirt I received really are tagless and the fabric feels nice (for the price).My main issue is the size - I'm a 5\"11 man, rather slim but I wouldn't say skinny. I ordered a Small (the smallest size they carry) and the shirts might as well be dresses - they reach well below where by butt ends and the sleeves half way to my elbows. I feel like a little boy wearing his dad's clothes.In the picture you can see a side-by-side comparison of a Hanes small vs. one of these Fruit of the Loom small.So if you're an 8\" monster - congratulations, a size small would look great on you.I'll report back if there's any change after a few more cycles in the washer."

Bit of extra padding, I will admit. My pants have a mix of 36, 37 and 38-inch waists. I'm not into dieting, and not really trying to impress anyone with my 18 pack. I mainly don't like being weak or tired. In size XL, this shirt is made for weak, tired, skinny-fat dudes, not muscular slightly chubby dudes.I usually buy shirts in brick-n-mortar stores. The last one I bought online was a Patagonia flannel shirt size XL, standard fit. I literally swam inside it, and could pull it out nearly a foot from my waist in the front (so I exchanged it for an L, which is fine, slightly looser than this XL). This shirt is VERY slim fit by comparison. Not much to pull out. It doesn't look horrible, and actually would be nearly ideal under a jacket if I never planned to remove said jacket. It just looks like I don't know what size I wear, or I really let myself go over the holidays. It's also a little short, like a bargain Untuckit.Quality-wise, it seems fine. Haven't decided whether to keep or exchange for an XXL.",
            "I love the colors - they are soft, subtle and even more pleasant on the eye than the already decent picture of the ad - I ordered the purple/blue checked shirt in size Large.  The cotton is soft.  It is well constructed, easy to iron and did not shrink when I tossed it in the washer.  The fit is nice in that it is not too loose fitting and is not at all restrictive.  I measure out at a 43 chest, arm lengths run between 34\"-35\" &amp; 15 3/4\" neck.  I'd say this neck is a little larger than that, so it is comfortable for casual wear.It looks great with jeans and my Big Lebowski Pendleton sweater.  I received compliments the first time I wore it.  The shirt has a well-worn, old shirt feel - principally because it is so soft.  Grab a couple.  You won't be disappointed.",
            "I ordered this button up shirt and I\u2019m happy with it. It fits really well and since I got the Standard fit, I\u2019ve got room to move around in it. I could probably wear a Slim fit Large or a Standard fit Medium but I don\u2019t want it to look as if it were painted on my 5\u201911\u201d 190 lbs frame. My only complaint is that the shirt is a lighter color blue than the picture. It\u2019s not a bold, deep color blue but more of a washed/faded type blue. All in all though, this is a very nice garment and I\u2019m happy with my purchase.",

I got the shirt today, tried it on, and the fit is prefect. If you buy J Crew factory shirts these fit exactly the same. It is a bit tailored compared to some other brands, but fit me really well. I'm 5' 6\" 155lbs and the small regular fit perfect. The material is fairly thin, which is perfect for warmer climates. I will order more of these shirts.",

The fit is just right, not too small and not too big. I purchased an XL and it is exactly the size I need it to be. The colors are just right--exactly as pictured--and the collar perfectly tailored too.What I also like about these shirts is the fact that the bottom is short enough that they're perfect for wearing untucked. Get this shirt and look through all the Goodthreads inventory. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the quality, especially given the prices.",
            "I started out thinking these shirts were going to be made from some awful feeling fabric like a table cloth.  For the price and being so affordable I had skepticism. I initially bought only one just to see how it fitted and how the fabric felt.  While Amazon has fairly good return policies I still would rather not mess with that if I can.  This purchase was worth the buy.As soon as I pulled this shirt out of the packaging I knew instantly that the material was going to feel great.  It's a soft smooth cotton material sturdy enough to hold up to daily use.  The fit is spot on, I'm 6'1\" at 210 pounds and the size as listed is correct. I bought the large and it fits great with a enough room to not be squeezing your body.  The shirt feels nice and light, breaths well, I typically wear these kinds of shirts with out an undershirt, the material has to be comfortable for me to do this and this shirt has it.  It's still 80 something degrees where I am at with the sun beating down, yet wearing this in the middle of summer feels just fine.Worth your money.I highly recommend Goid Threads. I really hope they start offering some don't stylish jeans.  $40 a pair of not unreasonable.",
            "For the price, it's an excellent casual button down that works well with jeans or shorts.  Don't expect a dress shirt to wear with a suit for this price, that's not reasonable at all.  The fit is a bit smaller comparative to a standard size chart so getting the proper size may require ordering several sizes and fits to see what works best.  This particular shirt is a great color and pattern.",

I am very impressed by the comfort, style, and fit of these shirts and I am in the middle of cycling out my current work wardrobe for new patterns as they come on sale.The patterns are pretty generic and forgettable and blah but for work shirts, that is fine.

They're tagless and all, very comfortable and won't fade much, but the shrinking factor might be of your concern especially if you order \"L\". Mine are \"S\" and now they fit like a slim-fit t-shirt which is fine for me but for some this may be relevant.",
            "I bought a couple packages of these in black to use as undershirts for my work dress shirts. I tried them on when the first arrived and the length was good. After a single wash (cold) and dry (warm) they have lost at least 2\" in length, making them near impossible to tuck in and remain tucked in. So for anyone wondering... Yes, these shrink quite a lot in the length.  Interestingly they did not really shrink at all around the chest/waist dimension.A couple other issues I had with these, that I have not had with other brands is that the seam along the bottom of the shirt and around the ends of the arms was not flat. If these were not meant as undershirts I envision I would be going through and having to do some serious ironing to ensure all the seams were down nicely.Lastly, the elastic around the neck seems to be of lower quality material and is not as taunt as I guess I would prefer. It definitely seems like a few washes in, the neck is going to be very loose and \"bacon-ie\" looking.I certainly will be looking to other brands from here on out.",

I prefer hanes for the simple fact the are longer than other brands an dont look boxy after a few washes not to mention no tags truely a great tshirt. Fyi i notice white tshirts always tend to shrink more than the colored shirts not sure why but in my experience thats what happens but still fit just a bit more form fitting. An just an fyi if a female is lookong for a tshirt for lazy days or whatever or just to wear on ick days if you have a little belly on ya nice cover for those days but if you have yourself a belly that is more obvious this may not be what your looking for or maybe try a size up.",

We submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a 20% restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying. We tried washing a couple times to see if they would get any better but no luck. So we are now using as cleaning rags.

            "I first bought these at a physical store when I was in the military. They were perfect. The material was soft, the neckline did not bunch up and there were no tags. I used them for years until the material was worn out. So, I thought I would buy more. Amazon sent me HeavyWeight shirts with tags. So I returned them and hoped to get actual ComfortSoft shirts. The second ones sent by Amazon were close, but still incorrect. They sent ComfortSoft HeavyWeight shirts. The material is thicker and slightly scratchy. The neckline bunches in the front. I will not buy these again through Amazon."

            "I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.",
            "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.",
            "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(",
            "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.",
            "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.",
            "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.",
            "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.",
            "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad",
            "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.",
            "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"

            "Great shirts!  Don\u2019t order the Long/Tall unless you\u2019re over 77\u201d tall.  I ordered the long/tall first and returned it for a regular size.  I\u2019m 72\u201d tall, wear a size Medium in most shirts.  This shirt is the perfect length in regular sizing and will stay tucked all day.  I took my picture in the long/tall and held my fingertips at my belt.  Regular size comes 8\u201d below belt.",
            "4XL is like 3XL but still too shortwhatever size you need, go 2 sizes biggerIf you have a GUT, as in being fat, or more circumference around the stomach, NOT your hips, then these need to go up 2 sizes over what you think you needreturning 8 of them different colorsTOO SMALL",
            "Review update: This shirt in a large fits me like a Dickies medium. I now have four of these shirts and I prefer them over other short sleeve work shirts. They are light weight and appropriate for Texas summers. You can wear them right out of the dryer with no ironing and the top snap button is handy. Returns on this item are a hassle so my advice would be to order one for sizing, then order more.",
            "My husband loves these shirts.  They hold up very well and handle all sorts of stains that are easy to remove. The starch does take a long time to break down so for the men that do not wear an under shirt it may rub your nips raw.  My husband loves these compared to the other brand because they breath very well since they are thin but that does not stop the structural integrity of the shirt.  He is a mechanic/fabricator so they hold up great to weld splatter and grinder sparks.  Those also embroider and heat press very nicely.",
            "This could be a great for the price work shirt for those that are not very slim. I am about 6' and 195lbs and the Large size fits perfect in the shoulders and arms but is HUGE in the middle. Looks like I am 25lbs heavier due to all the extra material in the middle/lower portion of the shirt puffing out. If they had a slimmer fit I would buy a dozen for work. If you are of a thicker build, this is a great shirt for the price.",
            "These are nice work shirts. The reason I purchased these were the open pockets with no flap and they have a slight taper on the sides of the tail.  Which, I prefer when wearing un-tucked. The other brand has boxed tail (no taper) with flaps on the pockets and is made with a little heavier material.than these. I have several on them but these had a couple different options that I wanted to try. The price on these were great and just like the other brand they come out of the dryer pretty much wrinkle free and the are color-fast with no fading. I have recommended to friends and will purchase again.",
            "These shirts are great in my opinion. My closet it full of a variety of Red Kap button down colors / styles. They fit well. I typically wear a 2xl tshirt but I order these in xl. If you're not sure how it will fit, order one and give it a test drive. Then modify future orders as needed. This brand is all I wear to work now. Oh, and i wouldn't call them \"industrial\" though. I can't imagine that they would stand up long term to significant abuse.",
            "Decent shirt, it is a good summer shirt, light weight, strong and comfortable cloth.  Which is what I wanted. I need a blue shirt for work.  Except the pockets are very small. I have to carry a lot at work. One of the reason I bought this shirt is because it has pockets. Unfortunately the pockets are very poorly designed and executed. The pockets are very small, undersized, far smaller then any other shirts I have owned and own. One of the things I need to carry is a pen and note pad. I like to put the note pad in one of the chest pockets. This keeps them from becoming torn up as they do in a back pockets. The pockets are to shallow and narrow to hold a note pad and pen at the same time. The left hand side pocket has a stitch to separate a pen holding area. This stitch is only on the top of the pocket which means anything else put in this pocket will get tangled with the pen. Such as eyeglasses. Unfortunately the remaining area in this pocket is too small to hold eyeglasses in the standard soft case.This means I have to find and buy different shirts.",
            "Very disappointed. After having our tailor sew my husbands name and unit patch for the USAF on his civilian shirts,  I washed them. We had just picked them up from the trailer. I followed the directions on the tags as always, and the collar seam is already coming undone,  it's unraveling. I have pictures.  I would like something to be done about this, as it is unfair that I had to pay full price for shirts that are  obviously defective, or very poor quality.  It's a shame, because we have always purchased this brand, and we have never had problems. The shirts usually last for years.",
            "Cheap material, wrinkles bad and baggy. Looks cheap. The size is way too big. There are loose threads all over it. The grey color has a yellow-green tint that my phone isn\u2019t picking up. Would return in a heartbeat."

I am 5' 8.5', 150 pounds with a lean athletic build, a 30 waist and 32 chest. A medium tank fits me just how I would like it to, not too lose but not too tight either. The material is a slick synthetic material which is comfortable for exercising or just lounging around it. It doesn't stretch, but it doesn't need to. The colors are vibrant and haven't faded over the 9 months I have had it. All and all I got what I wanted out of this tank and am satisfied!",

Because the price changed I could not get Amazon to just replace it and I was not about to pay more for it. After examining the shirt some more I could really see all the loose, shoddy stitching on the shirt. Basically its a nice shirt but the quality is terrible.",

When I try to return it I find out I have to pay 1/ 3 of the price of the product to return it. It is extremely frustrating.  A company should stand by their product and give you all of your money back if their product is not what you wanted.

            "DO NOT BUY GILDAN TEE SHIRTS ON AMAZON.I love Gildan tee shirts, they make a great quality tee shirt that fits comfortably at a great price. I purchased Gildan tee shirts on Amazon without issue for years.  But this year, starting around February 2017, Gildan tee shirts are sold exclusively by third party Amazon Marketplace vendors, not by GIldan directly.  These third parties continuously stock orders with tee shirts that are anything but Gildan branded and quality.  I went though several transactions with several different Marketplace vendors, I never once got an actual Gildan tee shirt, all of them were junk, and I wound up fighting for my money back each and every time, over a period of weeks.  It's a nightmare, don't do it.  The actual Gildan tee shirt advertised here is a great tee shirt, but there are really only two ways of actually getting it - one, buy directly from Gildan, but they are expensive and have very stringent return polices, so be sure you are ordering exactly what you need; or two, buy from a limited number of third party online vendors besides Amazon that guarantee authentic Gildan merchandise.  There are a very limited number of online vendors besides Amazon but they are out there, I found one and I'm finally happy with the products that I received.Trying to help out the next person from making the same mistakes that I made here.Again, DO NOT BUY GILDAN TEE SHIRTS ON AMAZON.",
            "not gildan brand! came from china with no label denoting brand. shrunk from 2xl to a small! my 5'5\" wife can't even wear them. i might be able to give them to my 5 year old grand-daughter! that's how much they shrunk! DO NOT BUY",
            "When I first got this shirt it was the perfect size which is difficult for me because I'm quite large and I wanted a baggy shirt. But I feel the shirt sizes are as expected. But after only wearing it one time it started to pill. And it is bad. The only good thing I can say about this shirt is that it didn't shrink in the wash.",
            "These shirts are just awesome. I was looking for a poly cotton blend t-shirt. I was going to pull the trigger on some under armour shirts when I stumbled upon these. I got 3 shirts for the price of 1 Under Armour shirt. I wear these to the gym, around the house, sleep in them, and pair them with a nice pair of cargo shorts when I go out. I cold water wash them, tumble dry low, and so far they've shrunk very little and are holding up nicely. I like how they fit slightly athletic and they have a good weight to them. I was glad that they weren't slinky or thin like most polyester shirts are these days. I have zero regrets and these are cheap enough that you can trash on them all year and replace them every summer. I plan on doing just that.",
            "I ordered several of these shirts in different colors for my husband who wears them under long sleeve plaid button front casual shirts. All T's were great, but the dark blue was a different type of fabric than the rest so 4 stars. I tried this knit vs. another I had from this brand which was heavy and felt very synthetic. The navy was the only disappointment and the others were just perfect and softer. The neckline on these t's hold up well and don't stretch out which many do with multiple washing/wearing so I keep on buying them. Fit is pretty spot on for a large!",

I specifically checked this old t-shirt and found out it was a Gildan shirt, and immediately found them here and bought some more.I marked \"somewhat small\". I normally wear a medium and they are slightly snug. I find a Gildan Large to fit me perfectly. They seem slightly smaller than an \"industry standard\" medium (as if there is really a standard that anyone else follows - hehe).",

I went with this one because someone said contemporary fitting which I took to mean more slim fit and less boxy. It seemed to be decent but I'll know better when I get the small in. Other than all that the material and embroidery seemed pretty great for $24! I'll change to five stars if the small fits well and it has all the buttons!UPDATE:The small came in, fits very well except a little tight if I extend my arms all the way forward. A small sacrifice to get a more form fitting shirt; really don't want to wear anything boxy. Just doesn't look good. It had all the buttons! Material is pretty good and stains come out easily. I never need to iron it and it does well in a standard wash cycle and low heat dry cycle. The collar will bubble up a little bit but can be mostly ironed out.

For fun, I decided to order these shirts in at the last minute and accidently ordered all 2X's but actually worked out fine. They seem to run a little small but I HATE wearing tight clothing so it could be me! The material is of excellent quality and my printer company had ZERO issues with imprinting them. The team LOVED the shirts and had many people ask for them or where I got them. They were very cool and seem to be of wicking material which I might have missed in reading about them. These arrived early, thank goodness! THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY BEING WHAT YOU SAY YOU ARE! I was worried for nothing!",

My shirts are tougher than others I have tried and clean up very well. I highly recommend the A-4 shirts for any outdoor activity .",
            "I ordered a men's small for my 6th grader who usually wears a YXL or adult S.  And this thing swims on him.  I wear a women's 3XL and I can put it on.  There's no way this is a small.  I had no idea that it wasn't returnable either, or I wouldn't have ordered at all.  I'll be contacting Amazon customer service and hoping for resolution since it's not at all as advertised.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that the shirt itself is nice enough.  I just don't know how you can find a proper size given that another reviewer showed it running super small.",
            "I don't know if this was a labeling problem or just terrible sizing.  I purchased the Large, and it didn't nearly fit as other large shirts do.  I've included a photo of the shirt laying on top of a Nike Dri-fit shirt of the 'same' size.  As you can see, this shirt is much smaller in all dimensions.  The price was low for a shirt, but high for something that will only be useful as a rag.",
            "I ordered two of these and have been wanting one since I saw them (or something similar) being used by personnel in Cabo Mexico that work outdoors all day. I didn't want to pay $50 for a Nike dri-fit as I won't be wearing it often. Package arrived in four days and the shirt fit perfectly. That is it fit loosely, hangs/drapes on my frame, which is what I wanted, not a tight fit. I purchased size medium in silver and white. I'm 6'-1\", athletic build and the fit is perfect. I haven't had cause to wear them yet (maybe this weekend in Tahoe), but I also got them to wear beneath my vest while riding my Harley this summer so my arms don't get sunburnt. Should work and for $8 it was a good value.",
            "I wear these on my bicycle.  They're thin enough you can see shadows of chest hair, nipple, or undergarment if you look closely.They wick away moisture REALLY well and are comfortable by themselves between 45F and 75F (6'6\" or 197gm, and 266LBS or 125kg).From 34F to 45F, these are fine as an undershirt with a thin jersey or jacket over the top, though at 34F, it's a little chilly until I'm warmed up.They don't block any wind, so if you're not pushing hard enough to huff and puff, move your temperatures up a bit.Fabric is durable, as is the stitching.  They are inexpensive shirts, and I like that.  If I tear it on something, no big deal.I've sent a few of these through the wash several times, and I always run them through the dryer on low-heat + very-dry.  The fabric has suffered no shrinkage, embrittlement, etc.These are the same shirts that some of the local print shops sell for 5x with a single-side print.If you run such a print shop, the price here seemed to be lower than what some local wholesalers had.If you are an end-consumer and don't need prints, or have your own dye-sub shirt printer, these are cost effective.Know that when I bought them, shipping for one was the same as shipping for 10. Buy in bulk if you can.These compare really well to all of the major sports shirt manufacturers such as Champion and Gildan.",
            "My husband wanted these as an undershirt for his scrubs. He finds them extremely comfortable and fit true to size. That being said, I'm not fond of how they come out of the wash. They go in with no stains and come out covered in them unless I use a gentle cycle with pretty much just these types of shirts together. They cannot have fabric softener used on them either. The first few days he had them the seams had loose threads. This is something I can fix but don't want to worry about in a brand new shirt. Just some things to keep in mind when purchasing. They aren't awful, just a little more work to care for and with 5 kids, not something I prefer.",
            "I now own three of these shirts in various colors. I'm a road cyclist and I bought them mostly for use as athletic wear. They provide better protection from the sun than short-sleeved jerseys and probably keep me cooler on hot summer days too. On the hottest days I'll \"prime the pump\" by dampening the fabric covering my arms and chest before I start the ride. The shirt feels comfortable and cool as the breeze evaporates the moisture. On cool days these shirts work as a windbreaker and help keep one warm. To replace the pockets on the back of a true cycling jersey, I wear a small waist pack\u00a0Everest Signature Waist Pack - Standard, Black, One Size.The shirts (especially in the other colors) are handsome enough to wear as casual clothing.",
            "I really like this shirt. Just biked 20 miles in cool weather. This shirt, unlike my normal shirts, stopped most of the cooler air from coming through. When the weather turned warmer, I was surprised that it didn't over heat me, and was really thrilled about how comfortable it felt- weather wise and material wise.",
            "Completely absurd. I\u2019m 6\u20191 and weigh 205lbs and the Large fits me like a trash bag. The large fits like a xxl. I go back to amazon to return it and turns out it\u2019s not \u201celigible for return\u201d. It\u2019s really cheaply made. The sizing could not be more off. I\u2019m usually an XL in t shirts, I got this in Large for a tighter fit to run in, and it\u2019s the oppoisite of that. Pretty stupid, horrible product, waste of money.",
            "I have bought this item several times, different colors. However, the last two items were sized wrong. Extra large on package, but shirt inside was a Small. Mis-labled somewhere. Check inventory. Not eligible for return, so donated to nursing home closet for other patients. Disappointed, because Dad loves to wear these shirts and pants. Vicki Reynolds"

I purchased a green polo shirt from you all on the same day that I purchased a couple of more polo shirts from the actual Ralph Lauren website. When my package came from Ralph Lauren it was perfect as always but when I received my package from you all I was shocked to find that the tag had been torn off and the shirt had noticeable pieces of thread hanging from it.

            "\u2022Those of you guys, like me that are out of shape-I highly reccomend\u2022I\u2019m out of shape, thus on the heavy side, (waist size 44w X 31L pants size) for perspective. Shirts I buy either 2xl or 3xl I\u2019m very self conscious, &amp; picky, those on the heavy side no what I mean when I say most t-shirts/a-Shirts are never large enough, which is why I shop around. I bought this JC DISTRO brand on a whim, I bought 2) one harbor blue &amp; one charcoal gray. They\u2019re very comfortable. The arm holes aren\u2019t huge so my \u201carm chub\u201d isn\u2019t totally open, also they\u2019re a good length so the chances of my gut &amp;/or love handles sticking out are slim! Not to mention, the fabric is an awesome, thick &amp; soft 100% COTTON. These imo are more outer tank than undershirt tank. Although I feel can be worn either way. It\u2019s July1,18 &amp; I live  in NYC area and we\u2019re in a 95-100degree heatwave, I wore the blue one today as my regular shirt.Buy w/ Confidence!",
            "My husband uses this tank top for working out and he really likes them. So much so, that we own most of the colors. Runs true to size and is a good length.",
            "Fits strangely. It has a great, athletic but not too tight fit in the chest and shoulders, then seems to give up as it heads toward the waist. Has at least two inches too much in the waist. It fits like a male, maternity tank top. If you have an awesome upper body and a wicked beer gut, I guess look no further. Meh.",
            "I\"m not happy with this tank top. It is quite baggy at the hips and waist. It does not look the way that it appears in the photo on Amazon. I did not return it because I needed another tank for my workouts and, quite frankly, I don't need to look like a fashion model in the gym, but, nevertheless, I wish it fit better.",
            "I prefer muscle (sleeveless) t-shirts and I'm not big on tank tops, but this particular tank top with the two-tone color looked good on the model, so I decided to try this product.I have a 36\" waist and my shoulder to shoulder measurement is 19\" so the medium size fits quite nicely on me. Plus, the organic 100% cotton fibers feels good on my skin as opposed to those sports shirts with synthetic fibers (which can cause me skin irritation despite the pluses of drying fast and whisking away moisture).So, the sizing, the color and the thread stitching is nice and I have no complaintsRecommended t-shirt product.",
            "Bought 6 of these and they fit great. Fabric is soft and not too light or heavy.  I have broad shoulders and narrow waist, but am only 5'6\".  Most shirts blouse up on the chest or in the waist.  These fit nicely - not tight, not baggy.  Will see how long they last.  I don't put them in the dryer, so so far so good.",

            "So I am not even sure if these things are authentic or not.  I have rocked many a Hanes white-tee in my day, always preferring the V neck for business (I rarely wear a tie).I had gained some weight (and recently lost it!), so I ordered a new size of shirt as I realized my tried and true XL under shirts weren't fitting anymore.  I ordered these in 2XL, and dealt with them for about a year, but they were honestly not much bigger, if bigger at all, than the XL was.  At least in the front or 'belly' section of the shirt.  I did not feel like I got any additional coverage by going a size up.  On top of that, the V is pretty deep in these shirts.I can't return them, I've worn them regardless of the bad fit and just dealt with it.  But I figured this might help someone else.  Also, I didn't have any issues with the quality of the cotton or anything else.  The shirts are still in great shape - they just aren't as big as they should be.I will be buying a different brand next time, and a couple sizes smaller due to having lost some weight!!",
            "The shirts are comfy enough. However after the 2nd wash, the shirts have fallen apart! I use gentle detergent and the normal cycle on my washer. I have never had a piece of clothing fall apart like this. Ever. I will not be able to return because I've already tossed all the packaging...and I've purchased 3 packages. Highly disappointed. Quality of these shirts have gone down for sure. Spend your money on another brand.",
            "As expected. I buy these every few year when the ones I have wear out. The material is thin, but I knew it would be. I sleep in them so it doesn't matter to me, but if you are looking for material that is thicker and more durable, there are probably better choices. For three shirts the price was right.",
            "They're what I expected and are suitable for what I needed: thin undershirts with a neckline that didn't show above my work shirt's collar.  Keep in mind that they will shrink in the wash.  I have a smaller build and was expecting them to shrink, so it wasn't an issue for me.Also, note that these are *not* the types of shirts you wear by themselves or with an unbuttoned shirt.  I'm not even particularly fashion-conscious and I don't like spending much on clothes, but these are too thin and the v-neck is too deep for it.  Look for a midweight or heavyweight material for those, and get comfortable with spending a little more for quality (the next tier up of Hanes shirts can work for this).",
            "These t-shirts are satisfactory.  They are too thin, even compared with the \"same\" Hanes t-shirts that I got my husband two years ago.  And one thing about Hanes t-shirts, they run several inches shorter than other t-shirts I buy, which affects tucking in and staying in my husband's pants.  But he does say they are comfortable, nonetheless.",
            "I said the t-shirts were to SMALL because I ordered TWO different packs BUT BOTH packs were SUPPOSE to be 3x. I opened them up and put away the shirts and went to work. After a few days and I was then off work I went to wear a nice, white t-shirt so I could cut my grass which is 3 acres so I wanted white to reflect the sun. I am not a small man at all but when I put it on felt awfully tight. After wearing for two hours I came in house to take a shower and looked at them and they were the WRONG SIZE. They were 2X and NOT 3X so know I have several shirts that I cannot use. I guess it is my fault a bit for NOT looking but one would assume AMAZON can fill an order and KNOW the difference between 2X and 3X.",
            "I am Very disappointed in this Hanes T-Shirt. Very poor quality. The material is so thin it is practically see through. They do not hold shape well in the wash. This shirt does not seem true to size like other Hanes T-Shirts.  I will not buy again nor will I recommend",
            "Wow. What happened to Hanes? They usually have a decent reputation but I got these for my husband and could definitely tell the difference. You could almost see through them because of the thinness and the sewing on the V-neck is a bit off. Hey, it's Hanes so I wasn't expecting something grand, but at least their normal standard. Unfortunately, this product was beneath that.",
            "What's not to like about these t-shirts? they're sparkling white when new and they fit better than the fruit of the loom brand. They're a decent thickness as to not be too see through even with my tan complexion. It seems to last about a year before they start showing signs of thinning and holes with a wear/wash cycle twice a month.",
            "These are the loosest t-shirts that I have ever received. I bought the medium size. The height of the shirt is good; however, the shirt is designed for someone with a much larger belly. I would not buy these again."

Anyway the shirt- for reference my husband is 5\u20199\u201d and 250. I purchased the XL and it fit him perfect. However, after washing it shrunk. Not a lot but enough to take away one of the stars. He can still wear it, and he does. It gets washed at least twice a week and it\u2019s now June 1 and it has held up well! I do recommend it.Every time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option. My reviews are always my honest opinion and I try to include photos if possible.If my review has helped you in any way, please click the \"helpful\" button below so that I know! If you have any questions feel free to ask! Thank you!",
            "This is one of my favorites tees, I wear it all the time. Its perfectly comfy, nice material, and still holds the image after tons of washes. I got a small because I think its a men's cut and I'm a 5 ft girl. It fits loosely but not in a baggy way and the bottom hangs just across the zipper of my jeans. I will 100% buy another one when this one is officially worn to shreds. For any girl looking for size advice, I buy girls mediums and this small fits very comfortably. Old snapchat picture uploaded but I don't think it really shows how it fits and I don't feel like taking another. It does show the scale of the image nicely though.",
            "I was really excited to receive this shirt, and I washed it right away when it arrived so I could wear it the next day. Unfortunately, the printing on half a letter and part of another letter flaked off and re-deposited on the sleeve of the shirt. It's just very cheap quality - you get what you pay for. Very disappointed.",
            "I waited to review this shirt until we had washed it a couple of times. I bought this for my son who is a huge fan of The Office. It fit great, he is 6'7 and the length was good for him so I would say it runs long. It washed well, I always hang his shirts to dry to prevent excess shrinking but the decal still looks great with no fading. The cotton is of a thicker variety and not the see through, thin fabric that a lot of t-shirts are nowadays. Great quality t-shirt.",
            "Um, it's a Dunder Mifflin shirt, so of course it's great. It's not the greatest quality in the world, but it's not intended for wearing to the Dundies or any other fancy event.",
            "The material is good and the logo seems decent quality. Mind you, I haven't put it through the wash yet but I can already tell it's going to need to be hang dried and not thrown in the dryer. It fits as expected which is nice, and the material feels decent against the skin and breathes nice.My only complaint about my purchase(I purchased two) is that one of the shirts came and the logo was pretty off center and crooked. So I got one that was decently straught(blue) and one that wasn't centered/crooked(black) and that's a little frustrating. But all in all, it's decent and I'm decently happy with my purchase.",
            "My husband typically wears a size Large in Shirts. So I ordered a large for Christmas. He wore it and loved it. It was a huge hit at his office. And was a bit large for him. We washed it with our other shirts as regular, and it shrunk. It literally shrunk like 3-4 inches in length. It\u2019s more the size of my Medium Women\u2019s shirts now. He tried wearing it and it kind of chokes him now.",
            "This shirt was a gift for my husband since he finds humor in the ridiculous show it references. He instantly loved it and insisted he get to wear it to a family function--an argument he inevitably won simply because I gave up the fight. Whenever he wears it, loads of people comment on it. Once we were strolling through the mall and a man walked by abd startled me with his \"Dunder Mifflin\" shout out. Surprisingly even other women compliment his shirt, but they must only get the reference because their husbands also force them to watch the show. Anyway, if you've got a significant other who is an avid \"The Office\" fan, this shirt is perfect for 'em. The shirt comes slightly larger, but nothing a good wash and dry can't fix. The lettering wasn't 100 percent perfect, in fact, the opacity is a little off, but it creates a little bit of vintage to the shirt. It won't really matter if your husband doesn't sort laundry and thus doesn't care about the item fading anyway.For size reference, my husband is 5' 4'', 120 pounds with glasses and regularly a small in men's clothing.",
            "I just got it out of the box and the wording looks very worn. As if it has been washed multiple times. It has a very faded look to it. I love this forest color green, the material seems nice, and the shirt looks like it fits well. It just disappoints that it has a very faded look to it already.",
            "This shirt is good quality cotton and looks exactly as pictured. It seems to fit as expected. I had an issue where the package was lost in the mail (not a fault with the supplier), and I emailed the seller and he immediately reshipped for me. The package came quickly. The customer service is excellent- that alone would cause me to be a return buyer. Worth the purchase!"

            "A gift for my HUSBAND.  He loves his run about T's.  He is 6'3 and 230lbs., with a stought build and the T's fit him comfortably for around the house and errands.  The colours are bright and nice after a few washes the T's have kept both colours and integrity.  Good purchase.",
            "Print is centered, very sharp and clear. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the fabric, I ordered the white t-shirt and it's solid and matte, so I don't need to wear a cami underneath at all. Did notice --and was counting on it-- that the shirt shrunk a bit after the first wash. If you are in-between sizes, I'd consider sizing up to account for the material shrinking.",

            "I weigh 290 pounds and this shirt fits great. I'm fat around my belly area and needed a shirt that had the hang style in the back so my butt crack wasn't showing all the time. Yeah I could lose the weight, but now that I found this shirt (and I plan to buy more) no weight lose for me!!! And my man boobs don't show to much in this shirt either. Only when my nipples get hard, but hey, what woman doesn't love to see some nipple action on a man! Am I right? Or am I right?",
            "This is a great quality shirt and has a good color too (burgundy). The only problem is how far the back flap goes. The front flap is at a great length but the back flap goes down pass my butt and looks like I'm trying to pull off a half dress piece.  So I recommend this shirt to talk guys and I think girls could pull this off just get the smallest model.",
            "Hello athleisure shirt! I've been trying to get these specific designed of shirts for a reasonable price, unlike those sold by YouTubers and other fitness-community fam like Gymsharks or Alphalete. I was skeptic at first in terms of fit since I've never worn clothes that is designed like this so I went for my 2 types of sizes that I would normally wear: my regular size of Large and also a Medium to see how it fits. Overall, both fits me well out of the bag/fresh from delivery (more on that later). I'm 5'8\" and 177 lbs. As you can see by the picture, I'm not too muscular nor overweight, just a good mixture of fatness and muscle--roughly 20% - 21% body fat. Anyway, I am wearing a MEDIUM here and my arms are hugging the sleeves and so is my pecs (chest) and it's nicely tapered down and shapes my lower body/waist area. Now for the large, I didn't take a picture, but basically it's almost the same minus the sleeves not hugging my arms as much and also it's slightly longer. BUT I washed and machine dried both of them right away like I would for any of my clothes and both the large and medium shrank a tiny bit, though not enough to make it unwearable. Overall, these are great and fits as expected not only for outing but also wearing it at the gym. I love my first 2 pairs that I instantly ordered some more since, why not? The price is right and it makes anyone out there refresh their looks by having a versatile and stylish shirt in or out of the gym!Note: you dont' necessarily need to be a gym goer to wear these by the way. Anybody can wear it, plus it makes you stand out of the crowd since the design of the shirt is not very common unlike your regular t-shirt or v-neck!",
            "I bought an XL in this because a men's XL usually leave me plenty of room to wash and dry without too much shrinkage.  Since I had never bought this brand before, I washed it in cold water and hung it up to dry - no heat ever touched this shirt!  Not only did it shrink a little in the chest, it shrunk considerably in length.  Before washing, I had extra room in the chest and it was long enough to cover my rear end.  After, it's a little snug across the chest and only comes halfway down my rear end.  I would recommend sizing up at least 2 sizes if you want to have some room after washing.",
            "Really good nice product",
            "I read reviews before buying this shirt and saw that it is a little thin and the stiching is not the best. I figured still worth a shot for the cost. I was plesantly surprised. The shirt i got was not as thin as i had imagined it is still thin but also soft and comfy. It did shrink a little after first two washes but again i expected that. The stiching is light and can easily be ripped but again for the cost this is not as bad as i expected. I got the 2xl and im 6 foot 2 280lbs with a large chest. I was worried the bottom of the shirt would be clingy but it actually fits really well. I was hoping for a little longer so i may go up a size on the next one but only for length reasons.",
            "Update: I just ordered a second one in white to replace the first one that I got which was sewed crooked. This one is a completely different fit and length. It is way longer than the first one I had and a little slimmer throughout. I wish it fit as nicely as the first one minus the defect. I won't be ordering another one of these. I'm very disappointed, I feel like I'm wearing a nightgown with this one.Original review:This shirt fits perfectly. I really love the way it hangs. Unfortunately, I'm giving it 3 stars for the poor quality control. The shirt was sewed crooked and the scalloped bottom was totally asymmetrical, off to one side. The seams on each side were in two completely different places. One side seemed to be in the correct spot, while the other side was clear around on the side of my back! Fortunately, Amazon refunded me. I'm reluctant to order another white one and have the same issue be happening, despite how much I loved the fit of the shirt.I also ordered the charcoal grey colored shirt in the same size and it fits entirely differently. It's much longer and more narrow. It felt and looked too tight for me. I had to return it.Perhaps I'll get the nerve to order another white one soon and fingers crossed that it will be symetrical.",
            "Awesome fit, long, just what I needed.Helps conceal my firearms as I have a longer torso and my normal shirts pop over my firearm.Quality is really really nice, should last a long time.Fits even better once washer.Neck is slightly larger (one star drop) but I did learn they have a premium version which corrects this.Anyways for the price these are amazing.",
            "I love these shirts. I ordered 3 of the olive drab color in size large ( I'm 6', 200lbs, athletic build). After reading some of the other reviews, the first thing I did was look for defects and check that they were all the same size. These are about as thick as a fruit of the loom under shirt (basic white tee) and you cannot see through them. At least in the color I bought. I normally buy the Bella + Canvas long body tee but wanted some color besides black, white, and grey. Comparing the two, these are shorter and thinner but you don't have to pull them up to sit down, they don't interfere with your movement. They cover your rear and fit really well.",
            "The quality completely depends on what color you get. White/Grey 100% cotton so even when washing on the coldest setting they will still shrink about half in size. Maroon/Dark grey is a softer polyester hybrid. Stays soft and doesn\u2019t shrink. Have about 6 of these shirts, just wish they were more consistent."

My initial worry was if there was a champion logo on the left sleeve since the picture does not indicate one. I'm 5'5, 125lbs and went with my true size in clothing, Small.

I\u2019m not really complaining, as this one only cost 7 dollars but it will be relegated as a work shirt and probably just be thrown away soon.",

I have never had a screen crack or a phone break.- Super protective but still has a slim profile- My toddler threw my phone in the bathtub, it sank to the bottom. I grabbed it out and opened the case to dry off my phone and it was completely dry.- love that you can see the Apple logo design on the back of the phone through the clear back.TRADE-OFFS- I have no issue with talking on the phone in the normal, typical way, but the case makes it hard for people to hear my when I am talking on speaker phone. I get around this by using a headset of the Apple headphones to take hand free calls.- listening to music on the phone speaker means hearing some reverberation of the case. Solution - just use a WiFi speaker- I replaced my case after a year because the plastic over the camera was too scratched and was effecting picture quality. This is cheaper than replacing my phone.- it can be hard to swipe from the bottom sometimes, you have to swipe on the sides not the center of the bottom, where the case exposes the edge.",

I can talk and listen to music just as before or with other cases.Yes the lock and volume buttons are a little stiff but I feel as though they may loosen up, if not well...I think I'll be ok.The mute button is pretty cool, at first I was like \"great it's not going to work\", but it actually works perfectly.I did have to register new finger prints, but I'm not sure that has anything to do with the case. Definitely works though, only fingers registered work.Straight contact to phone screen. Super nice! Definitely ordered a screen cover to fit this case because well the 7 is far from cheap and I get really nervous. \ud83d\ude43Swiping up from the bottom, just swipe up from the sides. You can't directly above the home button but still have plenty of room to the sides of the home button, shouldn't be a problem.Ummm ummm...cameras aren't covered in corners, quality still very good.I think this can answer most people's questions and concerns.

Its not nearly as bulky was other lifeproof cases that I have owned in the past and I really like the feel of the smooth, clear back of the case when I am holding my phone. The mermaid color is definitely more of a light minty green than a light teal or turquoise but it has grown on me and I have already gotten several compliments on it. Plus is looks great with my white/silver iPhone 7.Prior to purchasing it, I read several reviews that said its hard to hear during calls and that it is hard to access the dashboard menu from the bottom of the screen - but I have not had any issues with either. I was able to hear people just fine and they haven't had any complaints about being able to hear me. As long as you swipe up from either the left or right side of the home button the dashboard menu comes up just fine for me.I wish that there were better color options overall for the Nuud as they all seem fairly childish but I was able to find one that I didn't absolutely hate. I also wish that you could buy the alpha glass screen protector for Nuud separately instead of in a $140 bundle directly from Lifeproof. I do have a teqii mini2 glass for Nuud screen protector on the way, hopefully it fits well enough to not bother me too much.",

I actually destroyed a LifeProof case after two years on my last phone (I drop it on the floor, into a sink, into the bathtub, spill coffee, etc.) My previous phone somehow survived all of those things. Since I was eligible for a new phone, when my last case broke I didn't invest in a new LifeProof case and eventually my phone took a trip into the washing machine. It didn't survive. I ordered a LifeProof case for my new phone before I picked it up at the store. In this case, my new phone has survived a trip into a kiddie pool thanks to my toddler, numerous drops onto hard floors at work, and even coffee! I will always keep my electronics in LifeProof cases from now on. They are the best! 100% worth the investment.",
            "This case does what's it's supposed to - it protects the device from water and impacts. The unfortunate side effect is this case makes the device a misery to use. You practically have to smash the sound and lock buttons to get them to work, and it interferes with the shortcuts on lock screen- it completely eliminates the swipe-up control center capacity of the iphone. The speakers sound odd, and the case makes the phone too bulky for anything but high impact use.I'll use it for field work or on the water, but otherwise it's going to sit unused in my desk.",
            "I purchased this case on August 6, 2018.  Today is November 3, 2018 and the door at the bottom for the charger literally \u201cfell off\u201d!  I contacted Lifeproof and was told that because I didn\u2019t purchase from them the warranty was void.  Since I purchased from Amazon I reached out to them.  I\u2019ve been a member since 2013 and have had very few issues with Amazon...  Up until today.  IReached out via chat and explained my situation and was told to contact Lifeproof.  After explaining to the rep what I stated above, I was offered a $10 \u201ccourtesy credit\u201d.  I appreciate the gesture but I paid $30 for something that is literally supposed to be \u201clife proof\u201d and it failed by simple opening the charging port door.  It wasn\u2019t dropped or thrown or misused in anyway.  It was simply opened and it broke.  I will now purchase an Otterbox but won\u2019t be doing somthrough Amazon.  And once the new season one \u201cThe Grand Tour\u201d is over, I will most likely cancel my Prime account.My advise.  Do not buy Lifeproof cases!  They do not hold up to normal use and no one stands behind them.",
            "I wish I could write a good review because I was happy with the product... until it broke.The sound quality is better than most waterproof cases on the market. The microphone is not buffered and sound quality on the recipient side is near unaltered. The recess of the phone screen into the case is adequate so even with no screen protection, it is protected. I would recommend developping a specific screen protector like the standard ones on the market, sized in a manner that the case seal sits on it. It would create a really good product. I like the grip on the outside edge which compensates for the bulkiness of the waterproof case (which is to be expected) and provides good handling, while the sleek front and back permit easy pull out of pants\u2019 pockets. The home button Touch ID is still functional although  I am not crazy about the plastic film on top of it but it still works properly. The swipe from bottom of screen up to access tool bar is altered by the case seal overlapping that part of the screen making it hard to operate, and the volume buttons are hard to operate and requires excessive pressure.That\u2019s for my review of the case until it broke.The small door which seals the power plug clips onto the case. It happened to break on me. Not at the hinge but at the lip which makes the clip to close on the case. It is unfixable and may reveal a poor design making it to thin to be durable.So overall happy with the case but disappointed that it only lasted 3 weeks. I am a standard user, no extreme activity, always respectful of my tools, so it is again disappointing.",

I can\u2019t exactly review this specific case but I have the NUUD on my iPhone 8 Plus.  I am happy with the durability and waterproof rating.  I am hard on phones and this case has done a fair job protecting my outrageously priced tech.  If I could fault LifeProof on anything, it would be the durability of the rubber on the sides.  I haven\u2019t had mine for more than a year yet and I\u2019m already missing the lock button (mind you I crawl in and out of machinery on a regular basis).  The case also squeaks after a fair amount of wear and tear.  The charging port doors on these cases are finally a durable part of the product.  I\u2019m impressed that this part holds up as well as it does in comparison to their earlier NUUD cases.  Overall, I\u2019d buy a third one if I had too.  I wish they made these for the 6th generation 9.7\u201d iPads.",
            "This is the third Lifeproof brand iphone case that I've bought (I had one for a 5s, one for a 5c, and now this one), and I love them! They're great. Very durable: survives trips to the shower, the river, the swimming pool, as well as keeping my phone clean and un-shattered when I drop it (which happens more than I'd like). I'm clumsy and these cases work for me, so I'd recommend them, but the only downside is that it's virtually impossible to be heard when talking on the phone. I think the microphone might be covered by the case, but headphones and/or a bluetooth mic are a must when calling.",
            "MY FIRST REVIEW IN JAN 2019: Glad so far that I went with nearly identical Lifeproof case as I used to have for my previous iPhone. There are no cracks popping up in the top with this better case. I am glad it came in white with the light gray accent and the clear back. Please don\u2019t let that color combo go away. Lifeproof has that unique look that I love. It\u2019s great how the entire back of the phone shows through so it feels in a way that I am still enjoying my actual phone and color I picked out.  The back on this model case is so much nicer feeling than my previous Lifeproof case for my older iPhone. And do far I don\u2019t see any scratches.  Even the front white material seems to have been improved because I haven\u2019t seen any dirt build up on this case. The sound quality talking with it on is tremendously improved. The charging port opens with a pry of my thumb nail and it isn\u2019t so bad. And my nails are nicely painted. I haven\u2019t had a chance to use it at a pool or ocean until the summer, but I did do the water test according to the instructions.MY FOLLOW REVIEW APRIL 4, 2019: A couple days ago, without doing anything to the case (I am always careful), the lip of the charging port door cracked and a piece broke off. It is where your fingernail prys it open. I am very disappointed because this case was great up until then. I loved this specific style with the clear back and being waterproof. I loved the white with the gray because it is a nice look. I haven't had this case for 3 months yet and it broke already."

            "Let's start with the reason I bought these here. I was shopping at my local big box store for a pack of black undershirts. I was shopping for these specifically, but they only came in mixed packs (grey+black). When I accepted that I noticed the price, outrageous. I quickly pulled up Amazon and realized they were a third of the price shipped. Being the thrifty/realistic person I am I went ahead and ordered 3 packs. Same quality and three times the amount of undershirts. Either order your size or even a size up since they fit snug in a good way. Not something I'd ever wear in public without a shirt on, but they fit/feel great. Order a pack and enjoy. Remember the grey goes under light colors and black goes under mid-dark colors.",
            "These fit and feel great however, poor quality. I've had two of them rip at the should strap already. One in the wash after wearing it once. The second one while wearing it the second time. These came in a Hanes package but far from Hanes quality. Extremely disappointed.",
            "I'll make it short. Everyone else is right. I received what I ordered it is just really bad. Thank God for the free return. The shoulder stitching is ugly and weird. The shoulder strap part is way too thin as well it's like a string is hanging over your shoulder. Picture is of this item on the left and the fruit of the loom premium a shirt on the right. The fruit of the looms shoulder doesn't have stitching like that on the shoulder part. This shirt is soft tho but idk why u would want this",
            "Not As Described: The product description distinctly states Hanes Men's 4-Pack Assorted A-Shirt Color: Black/Grey.  There are two black A-shirts and two grey A-shirts shown in the product photo, . Both of the packages that arrived contain 4 Grey A-shirts.  I've now noticed a number of other reviewers state that they did not receive the correct colors either.  Either, the packaging description is incorrect as the package states \"Assorted Colors\" or what was put into the sealed package from the manufacturer is incorrect.Now to the fit:  The arm holes are enormous.  The lower part of the arm hole comes down to the midriff and the armholes are cut very wide.  It makes the back almost like a racerback and the front openings  are barely wider.  While the description states that these shirts are long, they are about 8\" to 12\" too long if you are a short to medium height.  The fit of the width seems to be correct.Quality:  The material itself seems to be of good quality for the price; however, the construction is just okay.  There's an open loop serger type seam on the shoulders that doesn't appear finished with a knot or double seam end and the thread loops extend past the material. I can only imagine that trimming the excess seam thread would create unraveling when washed.  The bottom seam is folded over and causes a lumpy appearance.  These are not the same quality as Hanes A-shirts that I've purchased in stores in the past.  I wonder if these particular shirts are overruns or irregulars.Smell:  Very strong smell of pesticide or formaldehyde.  I know many fabrics are treated with chemicals, but I also know many people wear clothing items prior to washing.  If you decide to keep this product, be sure to wash before wearing.Disappointing to say the least.  I will be returning the product.",
            "Many others have commented about the excess threads at the shoulders.  I bought them anyway thinking I could live with it.  When I got the shirts, I saw what everybody was talking about - the thread tape on each side of the shoulder seam extends at least a 1/4 past the end of the seam on every shirt.  The thread and tape are long enough to make wearing the shirt uncomfortable.  So far, I've thrown 3 shirts away without even wearing them - the shoulder seams came apart as I was putting them on.  Had to take one off, put another one on, that came undone, took it off, put a third one on, took that off, and put a fourth one on.  So, of the 6 shirts I bought, I'm only able to wear 3 of them.  (I hope.  I haven't put the last two on yet.)  Horrible quality and comfort.  Much too expensive considering you're going to throw away at least 3 of the 6 you buy.",
            "Hanes has really big fat fail here with this product and I typically find Hanes to be a decent product. I ordered XL because that's what I usually wear in every other manufacturer's undershirt (Dockers, Alfani and Merona) and they fit fine. After putting one on, I looked like it was spray painted on. You should buy at least the next size up as these are way snug if you are buying these. My son had the same problem with the Medium ones he got for Christmas (and he's skinny!)  Kinda thin material too, almost sheer. They don't look like they'll take too many washings. I guess the upside is that I have plenty of future rags for when I'm painting or working  on the car.",
            "I've worn Hanes Undershirts for years now, though this is the first time purchasing them online instead of through the store. As expected they fit much like the store bought kind, kind of loose near the underarms but mostly form fitting. The loose underarm bit however does cause one to occasionally adjust the undershirt, which can seem a little awkward in public; almost like a woman adjusting her bra.So while I do think this is the best undershirt I've worn yet, I don't doubt there are better choices out there. (I've just yet to find them.)",
            "Looks like Hanes: packaging looks just like it does at WallyWorld, logo on inside, etc.; however all four shirts in pack looked like they might have been seconds. The seams at the top of - right where the front meets the back at on the shoulders - appear to be unfinished with a ton of extra thread on both sides of seam, which this reviewer found odd and uncomfortable, like they skipped the last step to trim the excess,  and it\u2019s like the shirts are crooked and don\u2019t sit evenly on my body. I compared them to my old Hanes, same size, and my old ones have none of these issues. Befuddling.",
            "My only advice for people would be to go one size larger than your expected or normal size, because after the first wash these shirts tend to get a little shorter. Once that first wash happens though, you are good to go for about six to eight months or until you feel the elasticity using its affect. These are very good undershirts and will do their job for a long time. There's no point in buying fancy undershirts if you can only afford two and half to wash them all the time. Buy a few of these packages and you'll be good to go for a couple of weeks and really extend the life of these shirts.",

            "Awful. I bought these shirts after reading the reviews with regard to the neck stretching out. I have worn each shirt once after pre washing all of them a few times. They do not fit as advertised, are too thin, lack elasticity in the neck and are of poor quality overall.Highly disappointed in this product.I'm wearing one of them right now with my uniform as a matter of fact, haven't even made it to work yet and the neck is sagging to the point where it looks like I have no undershirt on at all.I have avoided purchasing Soffe t-shirts for the last 10 years or so due to quality issues, I should have known it was too good to be true to think that they had improved their product quality.",
            "I had so many questions based on the mixed reviews before ordering these shirts; Now, after receiving them I wanted to settle everyone's mind with a review... I would highly recommend this product. These are with out question AR 670-1 compliant with the most recently issued OCP uniform. The color is 100% accurate. The fabric being 50/50 Cotton/Polyester does give the shirts a lighter hue under natural light. However, this does not change the color in any way shape or form. I have provided a photo to compare a military clothing and sales product that is 100% Cotton vs the 50/50 Cotton/Polyester. The color is perfect.As for the fit, They feel softer on the skin than any other shirt I have worn in uniform. The neck will have a tenancy to expand for soldiers with larger size necks. However, Soffee has done an outstanding job re-stitching the neck to accommodate that issue extremely well. The neck stitching is a bit informal looking compared to the PX version as shown on the right. This is of no concern after reviewing the AR. As long as the shirts are serviceable you are good to go. I hope this helps!",
            "Alright, so first let me start off by saying that I served in the USAF and I've been wearing Soffe M280's ever since boot camp. Although I'm no longer serving I still wear the heck of these undershirts on an almost daily basis for working out in or just kickin' it around the house. Never have I seen any of these like the ones I just received - all of the necks are extremely big and look stretched out. I ordered a replacement and hopefully those will come in right. Check out the pic below and you'll see what I'm talking about.As far as the \"product fit\" above, the shirt fits great except for the neck and even my 20\" neck is swimming in these, lol.Hopefully, this is just due to a bad batch from the manufacturer.",
            "Not for Navy NWU type III.... The darker brown shirt is one straight from the NEX",
            "Whats with the big necks now??  These new ones have much bigger neck and thicker material. Problem is I work in a warehouse now and I need the tight neck to keep my harness from rubbing up against my skin and the light material to keep me cool. Thats why I came back to soffee; but no more these are awful. I could get bad shirts like these anywhere, I really need the old style with smaller neck and lighter weight material back. 2 stars since they are black t shirts and that in essence is what I ordered. Very very disappointed.Update: 5.30.19 images of shirts direct from military clothing 2004 vs soffe 2019 vs amazon 2017 the shirts direct from soffe seem ok as far as neck size and material like original military clothing. But the shirts through Amazon have a thicker material that creates fuzz over time and a much bigger neck.",
            "This was honestly a bad purchase. I was in need of Tan shirts for the military and I saw that this was a good price and had great reviews but the item was bad. When I bought them they looked great and fit good so I was happy with them at first. After They washed I wore them again and man the neck area stretched out with the wash!! I looked ate up when I wore them again with my uniform. It looked like I didn't  even have a shirt under my uniform. I wouldn't recommend this item.",
            "If you're in the military... you want the neckline to stay snug. It does that. Basically the best compared to some other cheaper brands.I guess what would count as a con is that it fades over time and wears out. I'm talking months over every day usage.  I would consider it wear and tear.  That's what we get paid for in uniform allowance every year. This is the last time I'm getting them, lol. Just got my avocados.",
            "These shirts are extremely comfortable and the body fits well.  The color is good and the material is very soft and seems to be weathering the hot water washes well.  However, the neck hole is HUGE!  I wear an 18.5 neck for dress shirts and the XXL has at least 2 inches space on all sides compared to most of my other tees.",
            "Great shirt sizing, I started wearing size large shirts in Gildan since the length would actually fit, but the shirt would be baggy. If I got a Medium, it would be too short but the right fit. Soffe gets it right with the length (which is meant to be tucked in) and the fit which compliments my body type.6'0, 162 lbs slim/athletic build, 32/32 waist for size comparison. I wear it as a regular tee despite its thickness (thin) since the dark olive color doesn't reveal any skin under the shirt. Would definitely buy again, and probably will be in other colors.",
            "In the picture, the top is this tan shirt that I bought and the bottom shirt is the tan shirt that I bought at an Air Force base. So if this isn't tan 499 then I don't know what is. If you need a Tan 499 shirt this is a place to get it. Not sure what shirts these other people got because there is an obvious difference."

            "I should warn that this is tightly within specs for me.  It's a HI shirt, so don't expect to tuck it in.  And honestly I think I got lucky on size.  If you have a gut, go one up.  Believe me, I wish someone who doesn't get these free from Amazon had told me exactly this.  Please help me put an end to these freeloaders who are giving inaccurate product reviews through their vine program.  They are poisoning all of the product reviews you know and trust.

            "I now have six of these shirts, but in different colors. While I like Hawaiian shirts, I am at that age where you see too many retired looking guys walking around in hibiscus and plumeria combos. While those shirts do look nice, I like something a bit different and not so \"look at me I'm retired and wish I lived in Hawaii\". These shirts are unique and I have been complimented on them. The material is comfortable and seems durable. I have washed and dried them a few times and have not seen any color loss.I had some older shirts that I hated to part with, but they were looking a bit long in the tooth and starting to fall apart, so it was necessary to replace them. These fit the bill nicely.I was NOT given these shirts as a discount and paid full pop. You really do have my honest and BIASED opinion. Cheers",
            "I love this shirt!  This is not the shirt to wear if you don't want to be noticed. The colors are vibrant.  This shirt is truly art. The material is strong but comfortable.  The design is unique.  I was a bit worried about the colors bleeding given how vibrant they are and the fact that they are hand made.  But there was absolutely no bleeding on the first wash.  Nor did the shirt require ironing out of the drier.  My only caveat is that it is somewhat on the smaller side of XL.  It does fit well, but just not as loose as some of my other XL's. So, if you are near the size limits, go for the larger size.",
            "Cool shirt but runs a little small.  Suggest getting one size bigger. I am 6', 265 lbs. 46\" chest and 53\" belly.  Usually can fit into a 3XL.  This oneis ok, but snug when I sit down.  But a nice shirt.",
            "When Amazon asked me, \"How does this product fit?\" I had to think about my reply.  I typically find that clothes I buy online, when I've never ordered from the manufacturer before, are smaller than expected.  So, I ordered a size larger than I typically wear, both because I wanted a roomier-than-usual shirt for vacation, and because I was wary of the typical online buying experience.I'm pleased to say that a size larger than I'd normally order was pleasantly roomy.  I probably could've bought my usual size, and had it fit well.It's a thin cotton but not an unpleasantly or cheaply-feeling material.  I like the colors.  I washed it in warm water, to see how that affected the size and was pleased that it didn't shrink much if at all.  Thumb's up.",
            "I don't actually like \"Hawaiian\" shirts. By that I mean shirts with purdy flowers and hula girls with thier pineapples (!) and such. I'm not \"Magnum PI!\"  I don't think of these as \"Hawaiian Shirts\" however. To me, they are like those \"tribal\"tattoo designs. These are great for going out during those hot, hot summer evenings. Or being a little more dressed up at a Saturday pool party, without looking like a cheesy \"hey baby I went to Hawaii\"old guy. You can be cool, without looking like you are trying too hard.  One mini-quibble: the color of 'lake' was a little bit greenish, (like a lake) I was expecting more sky-blue. It still looks cool (like a lake), anyway.  The fit and design of these shirts is always perfect. I have 14. You cannot go wrong with Johari West. I didn't get a free shirt or anything to say nice things about Johari West. I'm just an old retired guy who knows how to dress well.",
            "Husband is 6' 1\"  (weighs 220 lb) and I ordered the XLG shirt, which fits very nice.Had previously purchased another Johari West Hawaiian print shirt in XXL,  but it proved to be a bit large - also, the sleeves are an inch or so longer..Overall, very pleased with this purchase!",
            "My husband wore this Christmas gift when we went out last night and he looked GREAT!  He took it out of the package and put it on - it looked like it had just been ironed!  It fit him like it was tailored made for him. It can be worn either in or out of his pants. The best part was when I just washed it and took it out of the dryer and it looked like it was freshly ironed.  I would most definitely this product and the seller to others.",
            "Absolutely fantastic. The cotton is a peculiar one, I've never felt this type of cotton before. its smooth and crisp and feels very nice on the skin.The color is deep, the black contrast is engaging and overall I'm very happy.  The shirt is a bit large, but in the heat this is perfect and recommended for air flow.I will definitely buy another shirt and different color in the near future.",
            "Awesome sky color XXL and first shirt that comes out of the package wrinkle free!! Pocket is nice too. For those inquiring about XXL fit here is some good info to determine fit rather than all the reviews about too big too small etc. My chest is 52, waist 42, and 6-1\". The XXL is a good fit but a bit large even with a T shirt underneath. The length is perfect."

            "I purchased this shirt to match a my dress that is the same print for vacation. My husband approves of the shirt and looks forward to wearing it.The fabric is very nice a light. It will breathe nicely in the Jamaican heat. The shirt is very thin; which is great for our purpose. However, it is slightly see through and I would recommend wearing an undershirt if worn anywhere other than a beach/lake venue.My husband is about 6\u20191\u201d and 220lbs with a thicker neck, broad shoulders, and muscular arms hence why I ordered him and XX-L. He usually wear and XL but since the shirt has a collar I decided to order one size up; which was the perfect size.The shirt lays nicely when worn and does not easily wrinkle. At this time the shirt has been worn once and washed twice. I gave this shirt 4 stars as it has only been through the wash twice and worn once.Also, the shirt came with about five thread hanging out. The five threads were easily tied off and cut as to not stick out while wearing. Furthermore, the shipping was more than a few days.I would recommend this shirt for fun casual waterside outings or theme parties. It is not an office shirt though. Additionally, order this item with an expectation of waiting for it to arrive (about a week or two).",

The overall quality is questionable, I feel like it might degrade with heavy use but so far so good. I'll update my review if I run into any problems, if your reading this a couple months from now and my review hasn't changed, assume it held up well. In the meantime, I'm definitely buying another one.",

I couldn't even get it close to closing on my chest. if I tried, I could pull the bottom button to close making a crazy V shape with no hope of buttoning more.I really liked the shirt so I'm about to buy a 2xl if they have it",

My wife tired it on and wears a Med or Large normally and it fit her just a little loose. She got another Christmas present. Won't buy another from JOGAL.",

Really nice breathable material, fits great and the design is so bright and it looks really cool in person.

            "I'm 6'3\" 215 lbs with about a 37\" waist. The XL have been fine.  I really like longer shirts that stay tucked in at work instead of bunching up under my dress shirt.  I've ordered Jockey shirts that were way more expensive but were obviously better quality material when comparing side by side.  But since it's just an under shirt, these are perfect.  They do shrink up A LOT.  I ordered a second pack and compared one to a shirt I had been washing/wearing and there was a difference of several inches in length, at least an inch in sleeve, and probably a couple inches in chest.  So when you open the pack, keep that in mind.  They start out huge but shrink down when washed.",
            "My husband is 6'5\" and 225 lbs (very tall and lean). We usually have to purchase XXL, which means the shirts fit him in length, but are wide, which you don't want in an undershirt. These fit him perfectly! More of an athletic fit. He is so happy with them. They are also super soft. Great buy!",
            "Love these T-shirts. Prob my favorite under T on the market. Personally I love then cause you can get them in talk sized which is what I prefer. I'm sure there's other guys out there who can't stand how short a lot of the T-shirts are. I hate it when you lift your arm and it looks like your wearing a friggin belly shirt. Im average height 5'10 and If In having these trouble than I know there has to be others as well. Do yourself a favor and order a pack if these. You can thank me later!",
            "Never was a fan of Fruit of the Loom, but these tee shirts changed my opinion. I am 6\u20196\u201d and have a very hard time finding shirts long enough. I was always a Jockey fan, but price and poor reviews lead me to check other brands. The amazon reviews for Fruit of the Loom were really good so I ordered a 3 pack of 3x long, a size larger than usual. Should have stuck with the 2x long, but very happy with my purchase. Extremely high quality, very long, and a terrific price, (around $4.00 per shirt).. order some, you won\u2019t regret it.",
            "These are my favorite undershirts. It's hard to find tall clothing in the stores with out them being big as well, and the subscription service is the best. one pack every 3-6 months and my wife doesn't complain about me staining them any more. I wouldn't wear them by them selves, but I'm also a big fat guy that just wanted some undershirts that didn't shrink up after washing a couple times.",
            "These aren't perfect, but darn good enough.  Especially when you factor in the price.  It's tough to find a true big and tall undershirt - many brand I've tried are way to short, or the sleeves are too long, or the neck holes stretches way too much, etc.  But these are just a good, basic undershirt with no major problems in my opinion.  This is the second time I purchased these and the only issue I've noticed is that one shirt in the first package seemed to be slightly smaller than the others.  But after the second package I'm thinking this was not the norm.  I will purchase these again when I need more undershirts.",

THEY ARE A GOOD 4-5 INCHES LONGER THAN MY PREVIOUS ONES.  THEY HAVE NOT COME UNTUCKED ONCE.  I KNOW PEOPLE SAY THEY WILL SHRINK WHEN WASHED BUT EVEN IF THEY SHRINK AN INCH OR MORE, I SHOULD BE GOOD.  WILL JUST WASH THEM IN COLD WATER.",
            "These shirts advertise that they don't come untucked.  While that's probably impossible without velcroing them to your underwear, they do seem to come untucked less than the competition.  To be fair, I'm not sure whether this is actually a feature of these shirts or whether it is because they are \"tall.\"  Either way, they work for me.  They are comfortable and seem durable.",
            "I bought these shirts for my husband who has a really long torso and works in carpentry. He is always complaining about his under shirts coming un-tucked, and he gets a sun burn about 3\" above his pants, not to mention the \"plumber's crack\". I looked into getting him shirts from another company that advertises extra long tees, but found the price of $24.95 per shirt crazy for under shirts! I found these and figured even if they weren't long enough that they would be comparable to what he was already wearing, but they are perfect! Extra long without being too big everywhere else. Not sure if they will shrink up after washing but they appear to be long enough even if they do shrink a little. I am reordering more right now!",
            "At first when I put it on they were WAY long!  I thought this would be an issue... but I washed them in hot water with some towels and they are perfect.  They are true TALL fit.  I have gotten other brands that did not meet my expectations... but these are TOP notch.  I went ahead and ordered another set.  THANK YOU!The FIT: Normally I order Large Tall because I like my undershirts tight under my dress shirts.  but the XL Tall after a HOT washing are just perfect!"

The material is awesome and it's one of the nicest t-shirts that he's had. He has a bigger stomach and some t-shirts can really emphasize that but this one minimizes it and looks great on.

The shirt bunched up around the upper chest during pull-ups more than a regular shirt3. This shirt is long. Probably 3-4\u201d longer than most of my regular shirts. But that\u2019s in style now I suppose.4. The front \u201capron\u201d of the shirt is a wonderful polyester fabric that has exceeded all my other polyester shirts from Columbia and champion. This material is very thin and smooth and stretchy. The sleeves are also made of this material.5. i got the Charcoal (019)/ Black  one and it did show the sweat marks in an obvious way.6. The back mesh isn\u2019t as interesting as the front material but you can get some breeze through it.",
            "After buying one of these, I bought 2 more, and then after, 3 more. They fit amazingly. The style is great, and they work well with breathability. I can tell you my major sell on these is the length at the waist down. I've bought so many athletic shirts over the years and they all shrank up to the point where I could barely keep the shirt from going above my waistline. The shirts have at least a couple of inches of length to where they are never going to shrink up to the point of no longer being usable. They also never ride up during workouts to where I feel I'd have to keep pulling my shirt down while doing things. The fit is very athletic. I'm slim but I have some muscle on me and these shirts fit perfectly but also have some room to where it's not like a compression shirt.",

            "I typically wear a Mens Large t-shirt, preferable on the small size because I like them to be fitted but not tight. After reading the reviews I went with the Large with the expectation that the shirt will shrink a tad (like all 100% cotton t-shirts do after the first wash/dry). Pre wash the shirt was a little long for my taste and the sleeve had just a little extra room. Post wash the fit was just about perfect in the length, sleeve and chest. This t-shirt is NOT thin like some other review suggested and feels like a good quality 100% cotton shirt. It is authentic Grunt Style and fulfilled by Shophydra. In the pictures i'm 5'10, 176 pounds, chest 39-40\", waste around the belly button 35\", jean/short waist size 32\", arm/bicep 14\". I hope this review was helpful.",

I will definitely be buying more shirts from Grunt Style. And the best part is that the shirts are made in the USA, and Grunt Style is a Veteran owned company which just makes it even better.It just feels great to buy from an American company. Although there is one problem I have, while the cotton is home grown, and its printed and designed in the USA, the shirts are assembled in Mexico, kind of takes away from the 100% American label.But I still love this shirt.",
            "Arrived earlier, nice quality and design.  A mix of comments about the size and some  saying to buy one size up than what you normally would was not the case for me.  Glad I leaned towards the others comments saying get the size you normally would. I typically wear a large and I got the large and in my opinion fits like a normal large.  Hopefully it doesn't shrink much after washing and drying, otherwise good purchase.",
            "I don't know why people say this T-shirt is fake, I bought this one and bought another from the original Grunt Style website (because of the bad reviews) and I can't tell the difference, both of them have the same fabric, the same logos in the same place, the same good quality of the rubber, I really like this T-shirt and my boyfriend loved it.",
            "True to size initially. Soft shirt that fitted great.  It's gone through the wash a half dozen times so far and help up good.  Only complaint is that it has shrunk a little from going through the dryer.  Still fits, but fits like a large now, I ordered an XL.  So maybe order 1 size up to offset the shrinkage if you put it through a dryer multiple times.",
            "The Grunt t-shirt line is nice. Great graphics. They have one drawback. They need to use a better quality t-shirt. Absolutely no reason to cut corners and use a cheap t-shirt. I have several of their t-shirts, some that I have purchased from Amazon and some from them direct. You do need to go up one size or not put them in the dryer. Your call.",

The thing that really makes it stand out is the stitching: the seams look really solid, like I could wash it 100 times and they'll still hold together just fine.  Better than similar shirts I've purchased from other sellers.Decent fit, but a bit on the long side for me. I ordered a small and this seems halfway between a small and a medium in length. The shoulders and sleeves are a good fit for my body type.  We\u2019ll have to wait and see how much it shrinks in the wash. The tag is also going to drive me crazy unless I rip it off (not hard to fix)",

Then the there is the issue of accepting phone calls on speaker or not, and any noises the phone makes, gets turned into a vibration of muffled sounds. I did not like this case at all for that reason.",
            "Last week, I was working and got out of my car in a rainstorm and my phone slipped out to the curb into raging run-off.  I cursed and picked it out of the water and took it inside to assess the damage.  I dried the entire outside then removed the case.  Nothing inside the case was wet!  I work outside in the elements often, which is why I need a weatherproof case.  I like the slim profile (the OtterBox case is much chunkier) because I mostly keep my phone in my pocket.  Drawbacks are that the selfie camera lens has to be cleaned often with a cotton swab because dirt gets trapped in there.  And the swipe-up screen (for flashlight, etc.) is hard to get your fingers to because of the case rimming the screen.  I've dropped my cased phone countless times.  The other 2 cases I had eventually chipped around the edge, and was no longer water-tight; I replaced them both with this same case, as it works great for as long as it lasts.  My screen has never cracked.",
            "The product is very good to protect your phone but at the same time does not let your phone perform. After two days using it I had to stop because no one I called could hear me. The speakers and microphone do not work properly with the cover.If you use your phone to make and receive calls, this product is not for you. A lot of money for a product that does not let you talk on the phone.",
            "I\u2019m kinda confused why there are bad reviews on this. I really like the case and it keeps my phone from cracking. The only bad thing is that the case vibrates a little bit when your volume is all the way up. (I think it does this since it\u2019s life proof and the sound has no where to travel so it vibrates in the case.) but other than that, it works perfectly.",
            "Happy with it only wish the back was more slip resistant.  Other than that it\u2019s perfect.",
            "For many years I relied on a LifeProof case for my previous iphone (5c), with great results. Their case for the iPhone 8 is even much better! If you install the phone in the case correctly (which takes just a minute after the waterproofing test), there is no objectionable distortion of sound quality. The button moldings in the case are designed perfectly to fit and operate the buttons on the phone. Seriously durable protection is provided by this attractive case. Customer service (phone number is on their website) will walk you through any installation glitches. 5 stars."

Also ran over some sharp rocks &amp; stuff and didn't get scratched at all, underneath the shirt.",
            "I bought this swim shirt for a week of snorkeling in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. It continues to serve me well -- offering excellent protection from the sun. It fits more loosely (and comfortably) than previous swim shirts I've used, but stays on my body without lifting up when in water.",
            "I needed a shirt to protect my torso from the sun for an upcoming trip to the Caribbean.  This seemed like a great option and so I purchased it.  I really like it, but the size was not right.I weigh about 180 and am 6'1\" and typically wear large shirts, and so I purchased a large one of these.  It was a mistake.  The shirt was crazy baggy and would not work.  I returned the large (thanks Amazon) for a Medium and am much happier.",
            "Took the advice from others and ordered a size smaller, and glad I did. Photo shows black with white panels, which is what I expected to receive. Arrived black with charcoal panels. Would have preferred the white as represented. Please fix the photo, or send the right thing!",
            "This shirt does protect my husband from the sun; however, when wet it is almost completely see through.  I kind of thought that when I bought it, but white matched best with all of his swim trunks.  He wears it anyway, but I wish it was less see-through.",
            "As other reviewers have pointed out I can also confirm that the sleeves are extremely long. The shirt fits loose as expected but the sleeves come down to at least where my fingers begin. Its almost like this shirt was designed to have a thumb hole and cover even some parts of your hand from the sun. I really had high hopes for this shirt because long sleeve swim shirts are generally pretty expensive.",
            "The sleeves are a little long, though I shopped according to the measurements given. I am 6'0 tall and have a 46\" chest. But unhappy about it. The gray stripe on the side sets it off from my black Speedo swim trucks, so I like that as well. Looks good, fits a little larger than I thought it would but is not skin tight either. Happy, and now looking forward to playing in the sun soon!",
            "I bought his shirt to hang out on a boat and on the beaches of Hawaii and it was prefect for both those uses.  It fits a bit loose for swimming but it would work for that as well of needed.  I just prefer something a little more snug when swimming/snorkeling.  This shirt would be great for a day of fishing on a boat.  All and all a great quality product.  I would recommend this product.",
            "The sizing is off.  I ordered a medium and it is more like a large.  I wear a 34 inch sleeve and the medium shirt sleeves go down to the beginning of my palm.  I would advise anyone who orders this shirt to order a size smaller than usual.",
            "A really nice swim shirt except that the sleeves seemed rather longish; I am guessing to keep the backs of the hands out of the sun.Speedo cut it slightly roomy so that it does not bind; i.e.: same fit as the Speedo Easy swim shirt.If you are on the cusp between Medium and Large, then go with medium."

I've bought several and rotate them during trips, which cuts down on what I carry in my bag by quite a bit. Used them for hiking/biking/anything active as well and they're lightweight, breathable and wick away the sweat.I bought a couple about 4 years ago and found they've held up well, though I'd recommend just leaving them out to dry instead of using the dryer.I'm 6' 2\" at 185 lbs and the medium size is a perfect fit. It hangs well without looking loose. The shirt in the photo is the \"Sunset Red Heather\" color.",

However, once washed/dried according to instructions (hand wash cold &amp; tumble dry low), all the shirts shrunk a whole size and no longer fit. Buy a size larger than needed or risk throwing money away.",
            "I absolutely love these shirts. There's no real delicate way to say this, but I sweat - a lot. Summer is miserable for me, and I just had to stop wearing cotton shirts entirely between the months of May and September. I started wearing athletic-style shirts, but I don't really care for the way they feel. I bought one of these shirts on a whim a year ago. Now I have five. They're a bit expensive for a \"plain t-shirt\" (at least I think so), but they're totally worth it. Soft, roomy, and they wear well. They dry super-fast for a poly-blend, and they don't or feel like an athletic shirt. Just a great cool and casual shirt for summer.",
            "I work in a hospital and regularly put in 12, 13 or 14 hour days.  I'm a pretty sweaty guy and would wear performance shirts to stay dry, but after a long day you're gonna get stinky wearing polyester.  These shirts are a perfect balance; they are a cotton/poly blend and feel much better than normal performance shirts.  Also, when i'ts the summer and hotter than hell, they keep me dry as I'm running at my job.  I've bought these several times and never beed disappointed.",
            "I work in Florida, so it gets warm, and the UV protection is great. Very happy. Buying more with my next paycheck. wear very well over time, don't shrink much depending on how long you dry them. READ AND UNDERSTAND THE LAUNDRY INSTRUCTIONS before washing to maintain protection.",

I now have a Super Blue Heather color, black, red element heather, nocturnal heather and cloud burst heather. I feel like a weirdo because this is the only t-shirt I wear now. I plan to get the long sleeve version next summer.",

Not with these shirts, they last. You truly get what you pay for. I have a long torso so the fact that they have a Tall size is great. These are so comfortable and perform very well in hot humid weather. Even when they are soaked with sweat they aren't heavy, and they dry out very fast. I ordered a ton of these shirts after trying the first couple. I need more right now!",

The cotton is soft, the stitching on the logo and subtle contrast stitching on the shoulders are all well done.  It's a simple, timeless look that pairs well with jeans and feels great to wear.  I've already ordered another.",

Second, they definitely feel and look thinner than the older a shirts they're replacing. Disappointed as I thought these were the same quality as what I usually purchase. Not even worth the hassle of returning; will end up as rags in the garage.",
            "well.....im not too happy with these. if you are used to regular hanes tanks WITH the lables...you wont like these either.1. these are WAY smaller.2. these are WAY thinner/cheaper.3. the ones i got dont look the same as the image....mine have all blue printing on the \"tag\"...dont know if thats important but im mentioning it.the quality difference isnt even close. i feel like i could poke a hole through it with my finger....these things are paper thin and partially see through. simply put....these are NOT like normal hanes tank tops.",
            "I've purchased these before and had good luck but not this time.  As with any new garment I wanted to wash these before wearing them.  I estimate these shrunk 30-35% of their original size. The \"tagless\" label almost completely washed off 4 of the 6 shirts.  There seems to be a serious quality control issue.  Of course now that I washed them I can't return them.  These will be expensive dusting rags.",
            "I am 5'8\", 165lb. I have a 44\" chest, 16\" arms and a 31\" waist. I have a hard time finding shirts to fit my girth vs. my height. These shirts are a good fit. They are pretty long (down to the crotch of my pants) but they do not ride up. The chest is a bit tight, but they are fresh out of the package. I can see they will loosen in time. The material is comfortable; not too scratchy, but not too soft that it shifts. The thickness is good for an undershirt. The shoulder strap has a little extra thread on the upper seam that I removed with scissors and some seam glue so it would not stick out if I wear these without an over shirt. I will be buying this product again.",
            "When we moved from Wisconsin to Florida my teenage son really was having a hard time handling the heat and I was sick of watching him walk around with his shirt off. This was the perfect compromise. The shirts fit well, are made with quality, are comfortable and don't make you overheat. My son now wears these happily rather than walking around shirtless and I couldn't be happier. The price is also unbeatable for the number of shirts you get. I definitely recommend if you are looking for a shirt that you can be in the heat in that will keep you cool.",
            "These seem to be very different from what I have ordered in the past for my husband. I washed them like normal in cold water and the shrunk in length by 3 inches. So now they are not usefull to my husband because he wears them under hsmis dress shirts and tucks them in. But with not having that extra length and these shrinking as much as they did made it even worse!",
            "These shirts seem to draw up from the bottom, so I would advise getting a size larger than usually needed if you will be washing them frequently.  My husband wears them every day under his work uniform, so washing them frequently is necessary.  He\u2019s average height, and would really be happier if they would just make them slightly longer so this isn\u2019t  an issue.",

I have a bit of a belly and bought these to work out in. I would say they are border line too tight in the \"middle\" area. I hope that if / as l lose  some weight they would fit better. Not bad for the price but not great either. They would function fine as a cold weather under shirt. Shipping was quick. Price was good.",
            "I thought these were the super comfortable ones my wife had previously bought for me. I was wrong. These undershirts are perfectly serviceable as long as you don't mind them being a tad coarse. They're also just short enough to where they will come untucked at least once during the day. Other than those two negatives, they get the job done.",
            "These tanks, right out of the bag, exude a quality feel: thicker than you'd expect a tank to be and very soft. I'm 5;10\" and 178 lb and these are pretty snug on me, but then if I got back down to my cycling weight of 160 they'd be about perfect. They're dazzling white to start with an retain their brightness if washed in hot water with bleach. A quality product, recommended."

            "love the fact that the tank top parts on the arm pit sections are lower than normal, rather than riding up close. I tend to buy a lot of tank tops for casual wear or everyday wear and these are the first in over 2 years that are perfect. They have thickness, but not overly thick, two toned colored making them stand out instead of the basic one color style, casual looking but still nice and breathable. I also uploaded an image of the logo tag on the back of the shirt itself. Also the inside is tagless, while the tag logo part on the outside is 3 dimensional. Ordered this in grey/dark grey and blue/light grey and solid white one that should be in a few days from now.Very impressed and will definitely buy the other colors soon.",
            "great tank top. Fits as expected. I'm 5'11, 170lbs, fit and got a medium. The only issue I had is the tag located at the bottom seam, and only sewn on one edge of tag. It always wants to flip/stick out from under the tank. A couple of people thought it was a sticker and pulled on it; only to find it attached to the tank. Kind of awkward when someone secretly touches your butt to help remove what is believe to be a sticker stuck to your butt. So, I cut it off. It documents the material of the tank and  washing instructions. I suppose it's important to have, but maybe Champion should stitch it to the shirt so it won't stick out from under the tank.",
            "Good price, great fit and incredibly comfortable.  Extremely soft feel to the fabric that has a slight elastic quality that stretches to match your movement but doesn't constrict.  It also seems to limit wrinkling after washing or wearing. In addition it has a modestly stylish look that is a cut above the average cheap tank top I've seen or purchased.  I just bought it for a wear around the house comfortable summer top but it looks good enough that I don't mind wearing it out of the house to walk the dog or for a quick trip to the store.",
            "Can't go wrong with this if you're looking for a classic tank at an unbeatable price. They're not too tight like most shirts are nowadays, they have more of a classic fit that you would have expected in the 90's. Great for those of us who have average bodies and prefer a little extra room rather than the modern day slim fits.",
            "A U.S. large is usually tight on me, this large is actually a XXlarge tall.  The shirt was not advertised as xxlarge tall, as a matter of fact tall sizes aren't even available for this shirt.I am 5'10 and 180 pounds with a 46 inch chest and this shirt looks like a baggy dress on me.It's bad enough that shirts from Asia are about two sizes to small but now apparently I have to worry about other companies making their shirts two sizes too big as well.I don't know why the other reviewers are saying these are a perfect fit, but if you wear an extra large you need to get a medium for it to fit correctly.I expected much better from Champion, like maybe possibly a large that is actually a large.  This large looks like a seven foot tall overweight womans sun dress.Not worth returning, I guess I'll just give this to my girlfriend and tell her it's a dress.",

The width of the fabric at the top of the shoulders/traps ended up being 1.5\" on one side and 2.25\" on the other.  It looks terrible and I'll never wear it for this reason.  Not worth returning due to cheap price...",

I made the mistake of buying five and washing them before really trying them on. I have three Fruit of the Loom tank tops (Fruit of the Loom 5 oz., 100% Heavy Cotton HD Tank Top) to compare these to. The Fruit of the Loom ones were really cool and comfortable in comparison.",

            "I ordered a size smaller after losing a lot of weight, otherwise it would have been a bit large. But I would recommend these as they're very nice shirts for the price. If you're thin you may want to consider a size smaller than you usually go with.",

            "This is a very reasonable, sub-ten dollar long sleeved T-shirt. The size was as expected; however, the black is not jet black, which was apparent even after one washing in only cold water. It is also on the thinner side. If you are looking for something as a layering item, something to throw on for the gym, or similar, it as very adequate for that purpose and is priced fairly for that use.I personally would not wear it for other than outdoor chores, working around the house, sleeping on a cold night, or the gym. Your mileage may vary. If the colour had held better, I'd give it another star. While thinner, it has held up well fabric-wise, as well as the stitching.",
            "I ordered the Oxford grey. It is NOT 100% cotton. It is 10% polyester, so it didn't shrink much when washed and tumble dried. I buy 100% cotton shirts one size bigger because they always shrink in the clothes dryer (especially the sleeve length), regardless of whether it \"preshrunk\" by the factory. The seller needs to correct the information for this item to show that it is NOT 100% cotton. If some colors are 100% cotton and other are not, then the seller needs to clarify this in the product information.",
            "I bought 2 of these, one cardinal red and one olive green.  Colors are fairly representative as advertised.  Great price but material is thinner than I had hoped.  Won't provide much for warmth but would be a nice layer to an outfit.  I am 5\" 8\" and fluctuate between 210-220 pounds with the extra weight being around the mid-section.  Size is everything and buying clothes online has always been a challenge for me.  All in all, this is a nice long sleeve shirt if you can match a size to your body.  The XL fit is close for me but probably better suited more as an undershirt for layering purposes but a bit too tight for wearing on it's own on my size frame.  An XXL would most likely hang too long on me and perhaps a bit too loose but would be OK for something to sleep in.  Since I am not with the perfect body, the trick for me is finding the fit for the purpose.",

Surprise again, not much shrinkage at all after a few washings.I really like the fit around the neck and the length is much longer than the \"Fruit of the Loom\" shirts I previously purchased.I just ordered five more!",
            "I actually like this brand better than Russell. Better fit for me and material seems a bit thicker. Never heard of MJ Soffe before but the price was comparable so gave them a try. Wasn't disappointed. I like cotton shirts as they get softer and softer over time and breathe really well. Everyone has different body shapes so will have different opinions about clothes. If MJ Soffe is still around when I need more shirts I will buy from them. I noticed that in the clothes world that if you find something that fits well......buy several more now because when you need more they might change the product or might not be in business in the future."

            "Love these shirts and have been wearing them +/- 10 years... I own quite a few, wear them often on casual Fridays at my office, will replace them once they wear out, and once I\u2019ve replaced one I use it for outdoor purposes (I.E., fishing mostly)... Just a note, if you\u2019ve never worn the Columbia Perfect Cast shirts, know this.... Columbia Perfect Cast Shirts fit bigger than others (approximately 1 size bigger), I believe these shirts were designed for mostly fishing...  For instance, I usually wear a size XXL but, I buy a size XL when I buy this specific Columbia shirt...",
            "The shirt is the BIG catch -- not in the good way if you are 5' 5\" like I am! Oh, yeah, it's quite comfortable, stylish, and the fabric seems tough enough. But, I looked like a kid who got into daddy's closet! I really wanted this shirt, so I went to a local store, just to try on a medium. Yeah, it's within the definition of fitting me, so I ordered one from Amazon. Columbia lists this as a relaxed fit. Well, be assured, it's all that and then some.",
            "I have owned these shirts before. Getting my size is always hard. These are great all weather shirts but I really like them for hot humid wear. They stand up to repeated washings, don't wrinkle easy and make great travel shirts.As others have said, these run large, which for me is a good thing. If you want the current euro cut tight muscle shirt, buy a size smaller.. But for a roomy shirt that moves with you this is great.These are very well made of a heavy synthetic.....not some paper thin stuff that shows chest hair underneath.I work in construction so a shirt that looks good after a day of sweating in it is great....this is it.They don't develope that chemical/ onion sour smell over time like cheaper shirts do.The vents in the back work well on breezy days as well.",
            "I read the reviews before ordering this shirt. I bought one size smaller than what was needed. He wears an XL, I bought a L, and it fit absolutely perfectly. The material is so nice on your skin, like synthetic. It has a very nifty \"vent pocket\" on the back of the shirt as well, for breathability, and it is an omni-shade....... this shirt is an amazing find, great fit and texture, for an amazing price (especially for Columbia). I would definitely recommend this product to ANYONE. We love it!",
            "My husband loves this shirt. He wears the button down Columbia shirts all of the time so I took a chance and ordered this one for him for Father\u2019s Day. It is lightweight and looks a little dressier than other PFG shirts. Washes well and doesn\u2019t seem to wrinkle, making it a great shirt to pack for vacations or traveling.",
            "This is a very comfy polo that fits perfectly and is light and attractive with lots of breathability (if that is a word) features. A+ product at an A+ price from an A+ company. It even came with fast perfect shipping and packaging. Thanks!",
            "I love this shirt!  It is comfortable, airy, and well designed for full upper body movement and air circulation.  You can wash it in a sink and it's dry in no time ... hence a great travel shirt.  My only criticism (and the reason for not giving it five stars) is that either the weave or the fabric is prone to \"pulls\" if it gets snagged on anything sharp, and those loops are almost impossible to pull back into the weave,  Unlike cotton polo style shirts which are a tighter weave and less prone to pulls, this shirt which is meant for active outdoor sports is just a tad too delicate.",
            "This polo was slightly larger than normal in material as well as in the sleeves. If I was jacked up on steroids and couldn't comb my own hair this would fit me fine.",
            "Typical Columbia, top quality and slightly oversized. I order Columbia shirts a size smaller than normal for a good fit. Color is more muted that in the pictures, not as bright orange but still a good color.",
            "I ordered this shirt for my husband and got him an XL.  It was huge!  I exchanged it for a Large and that fit him perfect.  Very nice shirt and will be great for golfing or fishing this summer!"

            "Very comfortable and cute style for men or women. Lightweight, soft, good quality material. I love it! I'm 5'9 and 220lbs and it fits perfectly. It is a men's shirt but I prefer the fit to a women's shirt since I'm curvy. Product arrived sooner than expected. Blue is beautiful. My husband wants to steal it from me so I may have to buy him one now.",
            "Some of the other reviews said that it ran small... I normally buy an XL, so I bought an XXL just to be safe. I would have been totally fine with the XL. It's soft, washes well, and I like the fit. The sleeves aren't longer than they should be, the length of the shirt is right... It's not really thick, but definitely thicker than a standard \"vintage\" style. Which is nice, because it makes it hang nicr. All around 5 stars. I recommend and would order again.",
            "This is the second time this has happened with this vendor. I don't like the unisex style of tshirt and make sure it's a male style before ordering. It still ends up being the unisex style shirt. Not worth sending back but not going to buy again.",
            "I ordered the wrong size. My fault. Have called customer service twice. Both calls were disconnected. Not a good sign. I'll try again today but I'm not holding my breath. Should note to order a size larger than needed. On the good side, it was comfortably soft and looked as pictured.",
            "I'm grateful to the reviews that say to order one size larger, they are spot on.  The XL is the size of a normal large T-shirt.  It always feels so good to get the right size on the first try when ordering online.  This T-shirt is made of a very soft cotton fabric, not the usual dense, rough cotton you find in a normal hanes or fruit of the loom t-shirt-the sleeves don't stick out all goofy, the drape down properly on your arms.  I usually don't go for graphic Tees because, as a 39 year old man, they make me look like an immature degenerate, which, truth be told, I am.  This one however, is legitimately too hilarious to pass up.  I love it, it's my new life partner and I will lament its eventual passing.",
            "These shirts are great. My husband is very particular about his shirts and these are a nice light fabric and very soft. They're great quality and funny, of course! Have bought a few from this company and will buy more!",
            "First of all, it does fit as expected, perfectly actually. T shirt and graphic looks identical to what the picture shows. When I first put it on, it felt like a medium quality shirt. After washing, you can tell the quality isn't so good.  I've only wore and washed this shirt about 5-6 times now, and it's already shrinking length wise. (I wash my whites on a \"warm\" temp that is not hot and not cold, and I always dry my clothes on medium heat. This doesn't effect the other clothes) The shirt is now terribly thin, and nearly see through as well. Love the shirt, and it was a great price, but don't expect to get much use out of it or for it to last very long",
            "My husband and daughter both own this shirt. EVERYONE loves it. They stop him and tell him how funny it is. It\u2019s also very soft, fit as expected, and washes and dries nicely. I just updated this review to add a photo. Clearly my husband loves this shirt. It\u2019s slightly faded... but that\u2019s because he has worn it 88,362 times. I swear. I think it\u2019s his favorite. It is REALLY soft.The company, Crazy Dog TShirt, is great to work with as well. We had a shipment delay and they rectified the situation immediately. Great company.",
            "I had high hopes that the material would be as soft as they claimed, but it's stiff.What's worse is that the light blue color has sloughed off in several areas, leaving huge bright white patches. Mind you not one drop of bleach has entered my house in years."

            "I was super excited for my daughter to give this to her dad for Father's Day- he is always impersonating batman for her- but unfortunately the logo is way off center and just looks sloppy, a total mishap. If it was slightly off it would be doable (life isn't perfect right?) but this is just bad. I just read a review of someone else getting one with the same problem, only to be given another with the same off centered logo in response for her complaint.",
            "I was so excited to give this as a Christmas gift for my hubby who just became a new daddy. He was thrilled and washed it immediately to wear right away, but did not read the drying instructions and does not hang dry anything. I thought it would be fine, as we dry everything on low and it was supposed to have been preshrunk cotton. However, after one wash and dry the Large I bought now fits like a Medium and is too tight to be comfortable. So disappointed! Also, the \"supersoft ringspun cotton\" was, in my opinion, stiff and scratchy even after washing and using \"free and clear\" fabric softener. I don't know yet whether I will try to replace it with the next size up or not, as it shrunk in length as well as width. It's a cute idea, but I am disappointed with the quality.",
            "This is such a cute idea. Wouldhavebeenperfect if thebat were centered....should have listened to other reviews... Am I missing something are they SUPPOSED TO BE OFF CENTER?  Or are you selling mistakes at full price???",
            "It came a little smaller than I thought. I ordered an x-large because my cousin wears a medium to a large so I wanted to account for any shrinkage. It came in and it was more of a medium (in my opinion). The logo is really cool though and the shirt fabric itself was good quality. If you buy it I would really consider ordering maybe 3 sizes up (if they have it). The shirt really does run small.",
            "It's not printed exactly like it should be, kinda hard to tell in the pic and it also had a small stain on it as soon as I pulled it out of the package. Otherwise I'd give 5 stars. It's for my husband, he hasn't tried it on yet but looks like it'll fit right.",
            "Was small to start with and shrunk sooo much in the wash (despite low heat). My hubby wore it once before it became so small it barely fits me (small woman)",

He has a very muscular build and usually wears a XL, but I got a 2XL instead since some posts said the shirts run small.",
            "Just received this in the mail. Good quality material. My husband will love it! It, however, does not fit like an extra large. It runs small and fits him more like a Large. Luckily he will still wear it, that he definitely would have preferred it to fit him like an Extra Large",
            "Super fun shirt, friends husband loved it! He is a new Dad to 3 kids under 2.  Great material, doesn't shrink, and logo holds up well to washing."

            "I have worn Didkies Pocket T-Shirts almost exclusively for the last 7-8 years.  The manufacture and country of the shirts I just received has changed.  I usually purchase the 2XT or 3XT.  The sleeves on the new shirt are shorter than my previous purchase and the material isn't nearly as thick. You can almost see through this material which wasn't possible with my previous Dickies.  This is not the quality heavy material Dickies were know for.  The price was about a dollar cheaper than I normally pay and it shows in the quality.  The T-Shirt is still better than a 3-pack of Hanes or Fruit or the Loom, but your only getting one shirt.  I think a better price point for this shirt should be about $3 cheaper, which would earn it 5 stars.",
            "My SO often has difficulty finding shirts that fit well because he is big and tall (6'5''), not one or the other.  The problem is that shirts often are too short and ride-up when he raises his arms, even if the rest of the shirt fits well.  This one fits well - there's no obvious ride-up. There's really not a whole lot to say - it's a shirt! It fits well, it's comfortable, and the fabric appropriately soft.Edit:  I forgot to mention that he purchased an XLT version of the shirt.  So, if you are both tall and big, make sure you purchase the \"T\" size.",
            "I am not returning the tee as a reminder to myself not to make the same mistake again.The Dickies Men's Short Sleeve Pocket Tee Big-tall appears to have been made by an entity that generally knows the human form.The length is shorter than a regular Tee, and the pocket might be handy if arm pits needed a place to put things.Come to think of it, I do not think I have ever owned a piece of clothing made by Dickies that quite fit right...",
            "This is the second Dickies t-shirt I have purchased from Amazon. The first one tore in the armpit area, this one near the waist. It\u2019s not really a tear, it\u2019s just bad sewing and no quality control. Each of them were wore just once, then washed and hung on hanger to dry. The weight and material are nice, just very poor sewing. Quality control is terrible. I have purchased a few dozen of the Hanes Beefy-Ts, not a single bad stitch.",
            "It was supposed to be a big and tall shirt, that's why I bought it. Tall, meaning long.  My husband has a long torso and it's hard to find shirts that are the length he needs.  I was hopeful for this one,  but it disappointed. It's wide and not long at all. I guess I have another night shirt. Very dissatisfied",
            "I really like the price, the look and the feel of this t-shirt, and I've imagined ordering more, except for one thing: it looks like the inner edge of the collar is getting a bit frayed and I've only had the shirt a few weeks.  It may not get worse, and it isn't super noticeable yet, but that part of the shirt shows beneath any outer shirt and it concerns me that it may deteriorate to the point where I would only want to wear it around the house, not out in public. I can't afford to buys t-shirts that will only be totally useful for a short time.  I'll try to remember to check back in a month or so and report on this.",
            "I have been wearing Dickies work clothing for many years, it's always been very durable wash after wash. This is the first time I have tried their line of t-shirts. Normally in a t-shirt I buy just a regular length shirt. This time I decided to try a long tall version. I wanted the extra length primarily because I get tired of my rear being exposed when I bend over! I'm around 6ft tall, and this shirt takes care of that issue well. Compared to my regular length Hanes t-shirts, this shirt gives me an additional 3 inches or so in length. The material is not real heavy, maybe slightly thicker than a Hanes t-shirt, but that's just what I wanted. It's extremely soft and comfortable to wear, and I am very happy. I have purchased a few of these, and plan to purchase more. I believe me standing at around 6ft, the long tall is a much better fit for me, and overall it looks better on me than regular length shirts.Although it is tagless in the neck area, the care label is on the inside bottom at the side seam. I don't find this to be irritating, however some of you might. At this point, I have laundered mine several times now, and have not had no noticeable shrinkage. I washed according to the directions, in cold water, and drying on low.I am overall very pleased, and hope this may help someone else make their decision. It's really a great quality shirt.",
            "The quality of Dickies products is well know. No exceptions here. Thick and heavy enough to wear in the shop, light and comfortable enough to lounge around the house in. My only complaint is with quality control, not sure if it's on Amazon or Dickies, but mine arrived with a white stain, a little smaller than a dime, on the right sleeve. I don't live near a post office or UPS store so a return would be incredibly inconvenient. Hopefully whatever it is will wash off. Wish me luck.",
            "Really soft cotton from Pakistan, and a good weight to the fabric.  My boyfriend is 6'7\" and very slim.  I ordered the LT because he is used to buying large t-shirts, doesn't like a close or slim fit on his shirts.  The length is great on him, he is very happy with the length and the t-shirt overall.  The charcoal is a really nice color, in my opinion.",
            "I purchased 5 of these shirts. All five arrived with the proper size labels on the shirt and also the printed label inside the shirt neck. FOUR of the shirts are sized properly. ONE of the shirts is Waaaaaaaay too big. If I had to guess at a size for the 5th shirt (which, by the way is labeled XLT) I would guess that it is a 4XLT.I tried to return to Siberman but their automatic label wanted me to pay for shipping. This is a manufacturer error and I should not have to pay for shipping.I have contacted the company to resolve this shipping issue. I would rather return the shirt and just have them send me another one that is sized correctly according to the label. I don't care about a refund. I just want my shirt.On to the praise. I REALLY like Dickies pocket shirts. Love em. I will continue to buy these T shirts and I will keep getting them from Siberman's Work Wear. It's all in how the company handles it when problems arise. We'll see. I will update this review as this issue evolves.Thanks !"

Based on the size chart I would be a L (5'6\", 38B, 138 lbs)  but I did over one size larger, the XL, because I like mine roomy and  relaxed, and also just in case the rayon shrinks, which Rayon usually does, but not much at all in this case, thank goodness.  I wish there are hidden pockets, which make this dress perfect ... but otherwise a great easy piece to wear around the house or go out.  as to the chemical smell, there is a little bit of it, but I washed mine and use a nice fabric softener, so it is much better now, not bothersome at all.",

I could\u2019ve possibly went down to a medium (it\u2019s roomy). I like the fit though for my chest area. The material is pretty thin, but I love that for the summer.

The quality is comparable to that of piko clothing. The color was a little more brown than I expected, but its not like a dark brown. It still works for me. The length comes right about my knee cap, similar to the look that you see in the model. I am 5'5, 155lb, athletic build, and I purchased a medium.I am currently stocking up on some fall clothes and I plan to buy more things from this company!

And my two Levaca styles fit me nicely, even lengthwise. I thought I would like the flowing, draping style of the other garment better but I love this one as well:  simple on top with tiered gathers on the skirt. I like the simple ease of this dress. I am 5'4\", and \"the new forty\". Was looking for something cool and casual but nice-looking to wear at home and around town this summer, with leggings, or without. The fabric on both items feels wonderful; smooth and feather-light. The construction seems well engineered, although the waist on this garment wants to place itself a bit too high on me. (Busty women might find the waist crosses the bustline.) The waist is easily adjusted to only slightly high, but short of empire, and it doesn't bother me. I ordered the dark blue, which is purple.  The darker fabric doesn't draw attention to the waist, and will be lovely with brighter accessories for summer."

            "The web description listed the fabric content as polyester and cotton. The garment tag is labeled 95% polyester and 5% spandex. I ordered the shirt at least a size too large in case it shrunk. That won't happen with a garment not containing natural fibers plus I sweat like crazy in tops that are primarily polyester. For those who do like polyester, the material is soft and the color as depicted.",
            "I ordered this shirt based somewhat on the glowing reviews.  It's always hard to choose a size online, but since my normal size for items that don't shrink is Medium, I started there.  It arrived and was super tight through the arms and shoulders.  So I returned and tried a large.  although the large was bigger through the core  (where I didn't need it to be), the shoulders were still snug.  The neck line flapped around and didn't hold it's shape.  The fabric is paper thin.  I just didn't like anything about this shirt.  So the large too, went back."

            "\u00a0Let\u2019s start with shirt facts:- 95% Cotton (not 96 as described)- 5% Spandex (not 4 as described)- Bright, mustardy yellow- Delicate wash- Medium iron- Hang to dryI washed separately and colors DO run, so don\u2019t wash with anything the first few times out. Didn\u2019t hang up to dry, I laid it flat so there\u2019s no weird stretching.While it is a little stretchy it\u2019s not rubbery. Enough spandex to make it softer than a regular tee, but not so much it\u2019s silky and you can fit another person in there (they tried).Purchased size Small for 5\u20193\u201d, 90-lb. teen (skinny) and it surprisingly fits really well. See pics for measurements as I know those can be tough when buying online and the description itself says it may be off.It is NOT slimmed at the waist or fitted in any way. Straight, boxy cut.Lettering is good and seems like it will hold shape and not crack! That was my big worry for such a cheap shirt.Awesome message and decent quality, so definitely a recommended buy if you\u2019re a Mom of happily gay and trans kids or are just a fabulous human yourself!",
            "Wore to a T shirt expressions party and MPLS pride.  Received so many compliments.  The fit is on point and I love the add of spandex to keep the shirt form fitting.  The yellow is a bright happy yellow.  The words are printed on nicely and have survived the wash twice! Would definitely buy again!",
            "Wore this shirt during Austin Texas 2018 SXSW. It was a hit! Dozens of people asked me where I got it, several photographer wanted to snap it. Perfect fit, color, everything.",
            "I\u2019m 5\u20198 155lbs, 38D &amp; I ordered a Medium. The material is comfy &amp; stretchy &amp; it fit just the way I like it not too tight but not too lose either. If you\u2019re looking for of a more loose type of like I recommend you go one size up. Other than that I\u2019ve received so many compliments on it! I\u2019m happy with it",
            "I was pleasantly surprised with this shirt! I ordered it specifically for pictures because I believe in spreading positivity on my social media platforms. I thought I could wear it for a few pics &amp; that would be it. But it\u2019s actillay a soft stretchy material &amp; seems to be made better than I expected for the price. I normally wear a large/XL shirt, 10/12 jeans. I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d and weigh about 175. I ordered the XXL &amp; it fits good by itself &amp; since it\u2019s stretchy I\u2019m able to knot it too. If you\u2019re thinking about getting this shirt, do it! For the price you can\u2019t beat it!",
            "Giving this shirt 5 stars, not only for the awesome quote on the front, lol. This shirt can be worn casually, maybe with a cute jacket, paired with jeans and some sunnies or, it could be worn out for a jog with shorts or yoga pants (my favorite attire). My point is.. this shirt is versatile and can be worn many different ways and the quality of the shirt is just as amazing. I wear it quite frequently and wash it just as much, so far it\u2019s held up great and really looks like it can take a beating.",
            "I would like to point out that it runs small. I read some of the other detailed reviews before purchased. That being said, it's the only drawback of the shirt. For the price the quality, softness, and lettering are excellent! I can't believe people would give this less than 5 stars for something that costs less than $11 bucks! Geeesus. Every Unicorn deserves to have such a positive message for themselves and in their closet! HIGHLY recommend this product.",
            "The Quality of the Tee is excellent. It's your typical, no, it's actually even better than a typical woman's tee shirt bc it's so soft. It's  not to thick but nor is it transparent. The orange is more of a vibrant gold and the lettering is bold and black, large enough in block to get the message across w/out being obnoxious. I love the  Libtard Message (my words). BUT - folks, ignore that Size Chart and the \"Child's T-shirt\" description - both are incorrect.  I am a Small-Medium but ordered a Large &amp; X-Large based upon info in the size chart.  The Large was like wearing a really short dress, didn't even bother trying on the X-Large.  Am exchanging them for 1 Medium and 1 Small.  A nice Shout-Out to UPS for throwing another delivery into a bad spot.  Day 18 in a row. A brown mailer with clothing inside was tossed inot a tar and leaf filled puddle so close to a public sidewalk that any passerby could have easily grabbed &amp; go w/it.  Like FedEx, they don't care anymore about our hard earned money and refuse to leave parcels into  the safe places in which we instruct and they do it with impunity because shippers don't hold them accountable when items are arriving damaged or not arriving at all.  I will not bring filthy boxes or bags into my home any longer and am forced to open every order outside regardless of weight or weather.  My front deck, only 6' from an urban sidewalk is tiny but UPS can't be bothered to leave parcels in the clean safe place created for deliveries.  And with no vehicle I can't get to \"Access Points\".  They also never show up for Pick Ups anymore, but the thieves do.",
            "Love the saying, not loving the material. There is no way it\u2019s 95% cotton, it\u2019s too stretchy to be mostly cotton. It is soft and comfortable, but not like 95% cotton. Too lazy to return.",
            "I have a love/hate relationship with this shirt.First of all, I searched for months to find a shirt with this saying (and had decent reviews) and was excited when I found this one. It was a decent price and it seemed to have pretty good reviews. I bought this shirt specifically for a Kesha concert but thought that I would wear it for more than that.The size is smaller than expected (especially after you wash it) but I wore it anyways. It was a tighter fitting shirt so I stretched it out a little before I put it on. I would recommend ordering one to two sizes up depending on how tight or loose you like it to fit. I got SO many compliments at the concert and the more I wore it the stretchier ( more comfortable it became.I do have to tell you though, the quality of the shirt is great. The lettering has stayed on well (it's not peeling off at all). the vibrancy of the shirt is brighter than this picture shows (it is more of a sunshine yellow rather than mustard) which didn't bother me!I would like to see a V-neck option though. I would have probably bought that style instead."

            "Overall I'm pleased with these 2 tops I got and attached photos. I followed the sizing in the photos section and I would say that they are true to size according to that measurement system. I hate to put my size but since it could help, it's 38\" (34D) and 34 waist and 38 at the hips. So even though I usually wear a small or medium size, I purchased size large in both shirts. The thing that I realized is that because these tops can stretch so much - as you can see in the photos, I could have got a size smaller and it would have been tighter on the chest which I wouldn't have minded but not been as large below the chest which might have been slightly cuter on me because they do look a bit large on me.The brown packages were so cute that they came in that I took a photo of them which I attached.The material feels great - like a soft cottony, stretchy rayon - it says on the tag 95% viscose (rayon) and 5% spandex. It says to wash low 30 degrees celsius (which is 86 degrees fahrenheit), mid-iron and hang to dry.The arm holes are good in that they are high enough that you don't see the regular bra that I was wearing.The reason for the 4 stars is that the reddish/burgandy and white one - you can see that the white stripe at the top by my neck is not perfectly horizontal and that's annoying because then all of the stripes go down to the left instead of running level straight across.It is interesting to note that although they are both sized large, the multi-colored one is a full one inch shorter than the reddish/burgundy and white striped one.Overall, they're super comfy and nice for the price! And they arrived in just a couple days - I love it when you don't have to wait long!",
            "Ok so I was a bit confused on the sizes given. So I took a chance and purchased this in a size XXL. I tried it on and it fit perfect. I wear a bra the size of 38 D and I have no problems with this top and my size in bust area. I\u2019m 5\u20192 and weigh around 180. So if you are my size and want to try this, I recommend it. Now this particular top is not as dark looking as it is in picture. I would say it\u2019s more a red orange. But hey I still love it. I loved it so much that I have purchased almost every color it is available in. So I would recommend it.",
            "Im really disappointed in this shirt. I thought with the 4.5 star ratings it would be great. Not so much. The killer for me was the cut of the top. It comes in at the shoulders so that both bra straps show. I guess that\u2019s ok if you\u2019re 16 but that\u2019s not the look I want. It\u2019s also not a flattering cut for larger chested women. It\u2019s more square cut which is not ideal for a bust that is a D size. I think if you\u2019re 16 &amp; small chested, you may love this top. I had no issues with the smell or wrinkles because I always wash everything before I wear it anyway.",
            "Love this top and am back to buy more. It\u2019s soft and comfortable but well constructed. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d 155 and pear shaped. I got a medium and it fits perfectly. It\u2019s long enough that I don\u2019t have to worry about hanging out but not so long that it looks sloppy or is unflattering.",
            "What a beautiful top! I ordered a size mesium and it fit perfectly.  I am 5'2\" and my weight is 124 and it is not long or big on me.  The feel of the fabric is awesomely soft.  I ordered 2 and definitely will be ordering more.  A must have!",
            "This is a nice top for the price. I got the purple and it's more like a deep wine/purple color. It's very nice material and it has somewhat of a light sheen to it. It can be dressed up or down,, depending on your mood. I normally wear a size large, and after reading the reviews, I ordered a 2xL. It fit perfect, and the only downside is that the length is long. I am 5'3\", and it went past my butt. So, if you're taller, this will work well for you. Also, the armholes are just a big too big. I am going to wash and dry it in hopes of shrinking it down just a bit. Other than that, it is a beautiful and comfortable top. I may order other colors as well!Update...I washed and dried it in a regular cycle, and it still looks good. It did draw up from the length about 1 1/2 to 2 inches, which is what I needed because I'm 5'3\". If you're taller and need that extra length, wash it on delicate cold water cycle and line-dry.",
            "These tops are so cute!  Soft, flowy, and flattering.  The material is nicer than I expected and looks nice enough to wear to work under cardigans or blazers, but could also be a casual look too.  They are true to size, I am 5'4\", 140 lbs and 34D chest, and the medium fit perfectly.  If you are between sizes and/or less busty, I would size down.  I bought two of these (the black/white stripe and the paisley), and the paisley is a good two inches longer than the stripe far some reason, but they fit the same in the shoulders and chest, just the length varied. Also, the arm holes aren't as big as they look in the picture, so no worries that your bra is going to show!",
            "I ordered a 2X and it was the the size if a women's small. It's useless to me.",
            "This is the perfect loose fitting business casual type shirt. Fits as expected. Wrinkle come out easily. Soft, stretchy, and very comfortable. Highly recomend.",
            "The back of this shirt is sewn really awkwardly. Where the button closure is in the back, there is all this extra fabric that surrounds the opening, so when I put the shirt on, it takes ages to get it to sit right. Throughout the day, the extra bits kept sticking out. It's like the tag that won't sit down, except three times as big."

            "Can I tell you how much I HATE wearing an undershirt on a hot day?! It\u2019s so frustrating to look to look for shirts in the store and have them all be translucent, too tight, too baggy, or have words on them. I saw these and figured I could send them back if I hated them. Well, I LOVE THEM. They are soft, they aren\u2019t see through, and they fit amazingly well. I get complimented on them every time I wear them. Can\u2019t beat the price either. I can even wear the white ones without an undershirt. I have several colors and will buy more.",
            "I'm 5'5 about 118 lbs with a long torso and I generally wear a size small in tops. I ordered this in xsmall after looking at the photos and other reviews. 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating but that wasn't an option so I bumped it up instead of down due to the nice fabric.The bad: It does my figure NO favors. I don't like tight t shirts but ones that just have a little bit of shape that hint at there being a female form underneath and not a cardboard box. Unfortunately this tshirt gives me a \"shoebox\" body shape. I've attached a photo of how it hangs naturally vs when I pull it back at the waist so show how my body is actually shaped. If it was just tapered in around the waist even a tad more I'd be much happier with the silhouette.The good : It's SUPER SOFT. Extremely comfortable. The sleeves are the perfect length in my opinion. The neckline is also perfect for a casual tshirt. Not constricting at all but not flashy either. Great length. I'm wearing a nude bra underneath in my photos and I could not see it at all through the shirt. It has a nice thickness, but as you can see at the bottom you can see my shorts through it so don't expect to be able to wear a black bra without noticing it.All in all I think I will keep these as \"around the house\" shirts since they are affordable and so comfortable. If you want a nice weight, soft, non-sheer tee and don't care about it having any shape whatsoever, then it's a great option.",
            "Good quality shirt, true to size but clingier than I had expected. If you want to camouflage your stomach, try a different shirt. I like that the shirt is longer than most Ts, which pairs nicely with leggings. I'm 5'6, 190lbs with a gut and ordered the XL.The colors are kind of muted, with the 'purple' being more of a periwinkle in good lighting. The blue is your standard navy.The material is on the thicker side, so i plan on saving the shirts for the end of summer/fall. It'll pair well with items that will give belly coverage like a hoodie, jean jacket, or cardigan. I wouldn't order again, but I'm not considering a return either.",
            "I absolutely love them. I had read a lot of reviews, but I was still genuinely surprised at the quality of the material as soon as I opened the package. The material has some weight to it - doesn't feel cheap, thin or flimsy at all, and is soft to the touch. Be warned though on hot humid days it'll really cling to you if you're sweating a lot.The fit is perfect for what I wanted. I ended up getting the xxl because I wanted it to be huge on me and it did not disappoint - it goes well past my hips and fits very loose. I wanted something that was comfortable to do some working out in and lounging in and these turned out to be perfect. The color is absolutely beautiful as well. As soon as I got these and tried them I had immediately ordered another set! I'm contemplating ordering another one too.For the quality and quantity the price is definitely worth it and I say its a really good deal. Buy these and I guarantee you won't regret it.",
            "These shirts are extremely high quality for the price you pay. I\u2019m 98lbs and 5\u20192 and the XS are slightly a little loose on me but I\u2019m very petite so I run into that a lot. Still it\u2019s not a problem and they feel and fit great! Very stretchy and they are a little long but I am short. Get these though! You won\u2019t be sorry!",
            "I needed a few nice basic tees to round out my wardrobe.  I ordered these and a 2 pack of the v-neck as well, based on reviews I went with a medium.  I'm 5'5 140 lbs and 34B and the medium fit loose and was just too boxy for me, I'm going to reorder in small to see if it's a more flattering and feminine fit.  The fabric is nice and light, not too spandex-y like workout tops.  As to the white being see through- I was wearing a nude bra and could not see it, however the waistband of my black pants was clearly visible through it, so if that sort of thing bugs you these probably wouldnot bee good for you. They were long (mid hip), but I personally like alittle extra coverage over my hips especially with skinny jeans. The fit of these really reminded me of Old Navy - the vanity sizing kings of retail.  I always get size small in tops there, if that helps anyone.",
            "The material is soft and not thin - two important qualities I look for in a casual T.  I like the round-neck slightly better than the 'v' only because the latter tends to stretch in the collar a little.  I recommend sizing down if you have a smaller chest; otherwise, order the size you would normally get.",
            "These shirts are a really great deal - much thicker and higher quality than I was expecting! There's even some stretch to the fabric. The length is slightly long - not quite enough to cover my butt like a tunic, but still a skosh longer than most of my other t-shirts, which might be nice for people with longer torsos (For reference, I'm a little over 5'4). As for sizing, I'm a pretty solid L-XL in shirts, but as I like my t-shirts to fit a little looser I went for an XL here and they fit just how I wanted, so I'd say these are true to size. I got the heart print/black striped set and the pattern is really cute! I'm already thinking of the outfits I'll create...All in all, these are really nice, high quality shirts and a steal for the price - thanks Amazon! You're killing the game.",
            "These shirts are fantastic! The material is nice, and not see through (on the black and darker colors at least-I did not order white or lighter colors so I'm not sure about those). It's been so hard to find women's t-shirts anywhere that aren't too short, or see through, or boxy, or just plain cut weird so I am so glad to have come across these. I will be ordering more to replace all my old t-shirts I've been hanging onto for eons because I couldn't find anything I like anymore in stores. I wear an XL because I am busty, and these shirts in XL are perfect for me.",
            "These shirts are AWESOME. Super soft comfortable fabric that is thick enough you can wear over light colored bra without it showing. Great length and just tailored enough to not fit as baggy as a dude's shirt. I have been on the hunt for a flattering decent basic t-shirt &amp; I finally found it!"

            "I expected this tank to flare a little at the bottom as it's pictured. That's exactly what I need. My hips, bottom, and thighs are much larger than my waist, and upper half. Its so hard to find tank tops that fit in the bust, shoulders and does not have HUGE arm holes while still bring wide enough for my hips and bottom. I though this tank would work. It doesn't, really. I mean, it's better than most. The arm holes are not atrociously large, and upper portion isn't ginormous. But there is no flaring going on at the bottom. The talk top is pretty much one width from top to bottom which means it pulls around my hips. So, if you're buying this because it appears looser toward the bottom with a bit of a swing/flare, don't. All that being said, it was cute under a long in front, open cardigan.",

I tossed it in the wash with a full load then into a medium heat dryer. It came out unwrinkled and looking like new, so I'm a happy camper. It feels thin but in a good way. It is not see through! It looked like a regular shirt, so I even wore it to my office untucked over cropped summer trousers with a little jacket and realized that I can use it as a layering piece on work trips when I want to haul fewer clothes. Wear it to the office layered then pull on exercise shorts to workout, and this top can do double duty!",

            "My daughter and I purchased 6 of these tops for our 5 week trip to India. We wore them constantly and washed them almost daily. After hand washing and wringing, we simply hung them on a hanger and they dried quickly and wrinkle-free. Even the ribbing around the neck kept it's shape! They also breathed well and were so comfortable to wear. We were originally going to pitch them after we got back but they are still in such great shape and so comfortable I think we will be wearing them for a long time.",
            "I was excited to receive these shirts because I needed new plain t-shirts for summer. I read other reviews because I wasn't sure what size to order and the size chart said it was for reference only. (The size chart is way off.) I'm 5' 3\" and 190 lbs. so I'm kind of short and stout, but I have an hourglass figure. I like my tops a little loose fitting, but not really loose. I ordered XL because other reviewers around my size said it worked for them but these are pretty loose on me. If I had tried these on in a store, I probably would have bought large instead. However, I'm happy with the quality of the shirts and I'm too lazy to exchange them. They're pretty stretchy and I like that they're a bit long. I hope they shrink a little in the wash though.The only reason I took a star away is because if the fits/sizes are all the same across your brand (Amazon), provide an accurate size chart so we don't have to guess.",

It has just the right fit so it\u2019s not like wearing a boxy men\u2019s undershirt but not so fitted to make me uncomfortable about my muffin top (fat hanging over top of my pants). The sleeves are nicely fitted giving the shirt class.  I am 5\u20194\u201d 140lbs and purchased Medium. I might have fit into a small but have broad shoulders (and thick waistline) and prefer a little room.",
            "Ordered the 2-pack of white in size Small based off reviews and that is the correct size. I'm 5'6\", 34B bra size, size 4-6 in shirts (usually a small), 28\" waist (usually 28 in premium denim and size 6 in pants), and somewhat pear shaped due to having narrower shoulders and wider hips.I would give this shirt 5 stars for quality of the material at this price point. I love a modal blend and this shirt is soft and smooth, but not tissue thin. You do need to wear a nude bra with the white, but the material has a nice heft to it.The V neckline is moderate and there's no danger of cleavage or full coverage bras peeking above the neckline for me.I took off a star because this shirt is extremely long. You can see in one of the photos on the model that it's almost covering her behind. I would have to stretch the shirt to actually cover mine, but this definitely hits well below the start of the hip and I have an average length torso. I would say that this shirt fits like it was made as a tall. Ladies that are 5'4\" or shorter should be prepared for this to be tunic length.You can sort of tell from the photos that this shirt is cut to taper in slightly at the waist and then flare out across the hips. I find this flattering and I would say it fits in the bust and waist as shown in photos. If you have slim/narrow hips, then this shirt won't fit right on you.I purchased these shirts to be able to tuck into pants and they are certainly easy to do that since they are so long, although the shirt does end quite a bit beneath my pants' waistline.Note: I could have sized down to an X-Small and still have the shirt fit in the shoulders, bust, and waist, but I'm confident it would be very tight around the hips. I'm ok with it being only slightly fitted (as shown on model) and staying with the Small. But if you're hoping for a more fitted look, then this shirt isn't for you.UPDATE September 25, 2018: I wore these shirts tucked into belted jeans and pants throughout the summer and came to really love them. Fit stayed the same after numerous washes (I was on cold and dry on low heat). The material did not pill, but it's not as smooth and perfect as when I first purchased, which is to be expected. I still think the shirt should be slightly shorter, but I've come to like how I can tuck these shirts into any rise of pants. I'll be purchasing more of these 2-packs in the spring for next summer.",
            "I love that you cannot see through this white shirt. It\u2019s is a fairly thicker material. I am 5\u20195\u201d and weigh 185. I purchased a large hoping it would fit. And it surpassed my expectations. As you can see in the picture I probably could have sized down but because it is a somewhat stretch materia, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. It is a bit long as well so you could pair it with leggings to cover the bum and a sweater.",
            "Great quality, not see through.  I got the small and it fits perfectly-not too tight and not too loose.  I'm 5'8 143lbs, waist 28\".  Neckline is perfect, not too deep.  The shirt is a little too long, in my opinion, and i'll probably be take the bottom 3 inches off.  Still a perfect shirt though, I will be ordering more.",
            "Perfect fit!!! I\u2019m a 38DD, 5\u201910\u201d size 16 woman and the XL is true to size. Not to mention did not shrink in the drier. I\u2019m ordering more!!",
            "Purchased XL. I usually go with L or XL. Size 12. I'm 5'9\", 175 lbs, 38DD.  Loose fit around middle (which I wanted). A tiny bit tight around bust.  Probably won't throw in dryer.  Nice fabric weight.  Not too heavy or too thin.",
            "This shirt made of a good, thick, stretchy, opaque material. I purchased in white, size small. If it helps, I am 5\u20194\u201d 130#, 32dd. If you are looking for a men\u2019s style, relaxed tee, like I was, this is not it. This has more of a woman\u2019s cut to it, it is loose around my midsection and hits just below the hips, covers the midsection completely. Great shirt for the price.",
            "I am a 32 year old SAHM with two active little ones. I am 5\u20197\u201d tall, 135 lbs with a long torso. I purchased a size MEDIUM. These tees are perfect for my lifestyle! I love the look, feel, and durability of these tees. They can withstand a very active 12-hour day that involves heavy lifting (picking up a long, wiggle-worm baby boy multiple times) and various physical activities (chasing around an energetic toddler). I\u2019ve washed them twice and they\u2019ve held up nicely. I highly recommend these tees!!"

            "I didn't buy any hooded towels when I had my baby because I thought regular towels would be fine. Nope. It was always tough getting her head dry and quickly covering her body before she realized she was out of the warm bath and in the cold air. I wanted to get some towels for her, and I am so happy with this towel! I got the unicorn towel, and my 2 month old daughter loved it! She didn't cry when she got out of the bath and was smiling instead. This towel is perfect. Also, I washed and dried it immediately, and the unicorn face kept its shape. The only negative thing I'd say about it is that it came in too much packaging. A bow, lots of plastic connectors to keep it folded, and a hanger. Too many things to remove. But all in all, it's great for the price.",
            "I love these towels. First of all the price is great and the quality is wonderful. The stitching is consistent and finished well. The towel is soft and absorbent. Who doesn't love a little bundle of joy with an animal head. I use these as a topper for diaper cakes. I will be purchasing other animals in the future.",
            "Great towel!!! It's big enough it will last a long time for baby to use",
            "Those are just too cute!!! Love them!!",
            "We bought this to use for our baby boy. It\u2019s very cute, but I knocked one star off because it feels a little flimsy and too thin. We have a couple of other baby towels that were gifted to us that are a little thicker and softer, which are preferable when taking baby out of the bath so he feels warm and secure right away.My hope was that this towel would last our baby through his toddler years but I don\u2019t anticipate it holding up for that long.The price is decent, but when you think about the nice thick bath towels you can buy for a comparable amount, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it or not. This is a really silly and minor detail, but when the hood is turned inside out (which we do before putting baby in it so we can just flip the hood over his head) the bear\u2019s face looks really creepy because the embroidery is not covered.",
            "so soft and cute! I  have washed it but haven't used it yet. It is hanging on my daughters nursery door waiting for her arrival!",
            "I LOVE these towels!! They are very thick (but soft) and the perfect size to wrap up my baby after his bath. (I have a 10-month-old). I also love that they have a hood, of course, to keep baby's head warm. I've used other towels for my son before, but they were all super thin and too small compared to these. I currently have the giraffe, elephant, and the cute little fox. I think these towels will still be great even when my son is a toddler. You can't find these types of towels at another store for the same price. I would definitely recommend these to any other mom for their baby.",

Shipping was quick as well.",

            "I got this shirt in size X-Large. Although the chart says it's for 41.3\" bust, my bust is 42-1/2\" (for reference, I'm 5'3\", weight 185 pounds and normally take a large or x-large shirt in American sizes) and was comfortable in that area. The body shapes to an A-line, so it's looser around the middle and very forgiving if you need room around the stomach and hips. I previously bought an XX-Large in another color and it was HUGE, but I kept it to wear as a pajama shirt...the X-Large is perfect for me and goes great with jeans or even a pair of black dress pants.The shirt came out of the package a bit wrinkled, but that was easily remedied by using a hand-held garment steamer. I would recommend this shirt to my friends, but unlike similar shirts of Asian sizes which usually correspond to American \"Junior\" sizes, this one runs more true to American  \"Misses\" sizes.",
            "I had a really hard time deciding what size to order. I am 5'9 145'ish and I ended up getting a large based on some of the reviews I read. When I pulled it out of the bag it looks HUGE! When I put it on it was okay. I would have been fine with medium also.  The print is adorable. I feel like this runs true to size. If you normally wear a medium, get a medium. I am not planning to send this back, I will be able to shrink it some! Very cute!",
            "\u00a0I\u2019m normally a small, and ordered a small. It is slightly right in the sleeves, but I have chubby arms. I\u2019m 5\u2019, 143, and busty. I found this top top be exactly as described. The stitching is clean and the seams lay nice and flat. I like the color contrast, which adds a bit more variety. The floral pattern is only on the front, while the color and stripes are on the back. It has a curved hemline, which is way more flattering than a straight one. The shirt is also flowy, and gives a good bit of room in the waist area if you are self-conscience there. I\u2019m not sure this would be long enough to wear with leggings, but you could probably size up to have it longer. The fabric is thin, but really soft and not see-through with a nude bra.",

I am 5'11'' size 10, so I ordered a large. I love that this shirt is long and fits somewhat loosely, without clinging anywhere. Also, I live where the temp. routinely reaches 110F+ and this top has kept me cool and almost has a wicking quality to it. To top it off, I have received multiple compliments while wearing it, so it's definitely a keeper!",

            "Toms are a tight fit until the shoe conforms  to your individual foot shape. I recommend buying your actual size not downsize or upsize.  Even with horrible bunions the shoes will work. Just give yourself a couple days and you will love the fit.  I can wear Toms shoes and foot problems go unnoticed. If you are a person that can\u2019t wear just anything and waisted money for comfort and style, you just might have found a solution.  Try Toms",
            "I have had these shoes for less than a month and they are absolutely destroyed!  I guess the chambray fabric just isn't sturdy enough!  The shoes are super comfortable but I'm going to go back to canvas TOMS from now on.  Incredibly disappointing!",
            "I was always curious about Toms shoes. So many people I saw had them and after a few years, I finally decided to join the bandwagon. I chose a fairly neutral blue to match much of my wardrobe. As previous reviewers have said, I agree that they are (oddly enough) very comfortable for quite a simplistic shoe. The first day I wore them, however, I did get red marks on the top of my foot (from the \u201ctriangle\u201d section), but I wore them again the next day and didn\u2019t. I figured I just needed to loosen them up a bit. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with my purchase. I wouldn\u2019t buy them full price, but I\u2019d wait for another deal.",
            "I have never tried TOMS brand shoes before, but I'm always on the lookout for comfy, stylish walking shoes. While I like ballet flats, sizing and fit is always tricky with my narrow, in-between sizes feet.I really liked the feel of these shoes, and they seem like they would be really comfortable, however they're too big. Depending on the shoe brand, I usually fall between a 7 and 7.5. Some reviews said they ran small, so I ordered these in 7.5. I probably should have gotten a 7. Perhaps the sizing varies across the different models and materials. I like these enough that I will try to exchange for the right size.I ordered the Rose Gold Crochet Glitter pair, but I would call it more of a champagne than rose gold. It's pretty close to the product photo.",
            "I love the look of these shoes, but the quality is absolutely terrible. These shoes squeak like crazy and it's really obnoxious. I have two pairs, unfortunately, because I thought they would last. One is a 13 and one is a 12 (in black) as I am right in between sizes. Therefore, I can rule out it being a 'fit' issue. It's definitely the shoe. Additionally, I've worn these maybe 7 times and had them for just over a month and the material is already tearing. It'll be another couple of wears before they are complete trash. The seller should do the right thing and replace them.",
            "So these came too small, different sole, different.... everything... yet they looked like Toms. I wondered if they were fakes. But maybe I just had to break them in again? I stared at the box, it looked legit, even though my old ones didn't come in a box (got them at Urban Outfitters). Something was just off, and too much of it. Then I went online and read the reviews... my hunch was right. These are fakes. I don't know how they were able to manipulate their reviews or how they're still on here, but I'm so glad I caught this in time!",
            "I ordered the Ash Women's classic Toms which as pictured have the animal inside print. I have owned these shoes before and they are more expensive than the Gray color pictured with the striped interior print. I paid the higher price, but received in the mail the gray shoes with the interior stripes exactly like the picture when you click on gray as your color. They had a tag attached that said Ash, but this was not what was pictured when purchased. Very disappointed as my previous ash shoes were my favorite Toms, but I wore them so often that they had a hole in them.",
            "I really wanted these to work as I've been looking for a slip on shoe for casual use. The denim looks good and it was a lot softer than I expected which made them so comfortable. Unfortunately, I'm right between sizes 12 and 13 for Tom's which is right where they stop making half sizes. I even tried a few other standard loafers from Tom's and have the same issue which is a pity. Their 12's feel like they're pinching too much and I can feel the edges of the sole under the sides of my feet. 13's go on and off too easily so they'll just be loose slippers when they break in. If there was a 12.5, these would get a 5 star. I did like them besides sizing.If you're like me and have slightly wider feet or fall between sizes, check out Tom's Avalon Sneakers. They're similarly priced, look somewhat similar but the main difference is they'll have a thicker and slightly wider base which will be more forgiving size wise and honestly a bit more comfortable walking in them. I fit into a size 12 so size down if you're in between.If someone is playing detective on my reviews, I am copying this review to the other Tom's that I tried on.",
            "I love my TOMS! They run a little small so I had to return the original size I bought for a bigger size, but these fit great (I\u2019m usually a 9 but had to buy a 10 in those shoes). At first they feel a little tight, especially around the toe box, but after using them a few times they stretch out and fit your feet better. These are my go to goes to go out and about like grocery shopping, etc. They are comfortable and love that I can just slip them on without having to tie any laces. Recommended!",
            "I once wore toms and had about five pairs at one time about 4-5 years ago and although I normally wore a 7.5 shoe size, I would get a 6.5 in TOMS because at that time they ran big. With that being said, after reading the reviews and understanding that over time the sizing may have changed... I purchased my true to size, size in these TOMS and got a 7.5. They were a little hard to get my heel into the first time (without socks) but with \u201cno show\u201d socks my feet slipped right into them and they had a nice tight feel. I know TOMS stretch out over time so I liked the snugness of them and comfort in knowing they weren\u2019t going to end up being too big after a little stretching out. I wore them an entire day and they already feel like they\u2019re forming to my feet for an ultimate better fit.For reference,I true to size wear a 7.5 in vans, most nikes, boots, etc. I do have slightly wider feet and with some shoes like sandals or ones I know will have a snugger or slimmer fit I bump up to an 8. Hope this helps as this was the type of review I needed when debating on what size to get."

I was looking for a loose fitting shirt with a lower neckline to wear with a bodice that I intended on getting at the festival. This shirt was perfect! I purchased a size small and it fit me really well. If you don't want it too loose, definitely size down and reference the size chart in the photos that the shop provides. They helped me. The best part of the shirt was the quality for the price. It was very soft and the button were sturdy. It's a lighter material and definitely kept me cool in the Florida heat. I would definitely recommend!",
            "I would suggest to go down a size unless you have bigger arms. The arms are snug stretchy fabric but the body is kind of maternityish(see photos) it is nicely made and fabric nice (thin stretchy nice feel) but I didn\u2019t care for how it cut up on the sides.  I am 5\u20193 weigh 170 with smaller shoulders/bigger hips.  I ordered my typical size- large but think the med might be better for me in the stomach area.Hope this helps",

            "Cute top to lounge around in on cooler nights. Material is very soft but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this top in a light color because it\u2019s thin. If you hold it up in the light you can see through it. I\u2019m a 38C and the medium fits perfectly.",
            "This top is very pretty. The actual color was slightly lighter than the picture, but not enough of a difference to change my opinion. The fabric is soft, yet it feels very sturdy, I think it will last a good while. I washed it for the first time last night and the color didn't run, which is good because I didn't think about that before washing! The buttons seem stitched securely, and I found no problems with construction or fabric integrity. For size reference, I am 5'0\", 38C bra, 40\" hip, 36\" waist. I could have easily fit into the medium, but the large is comfortably loose, not too loose, the way I typically like to wear my tunics. It covers enough that I felt comfortable wearing jeggings with it, but not regular leggings, about an inch below the crotch line and hip line. It pairs very well with dark colored jeggings and cowgirl boots. I love the detail at the top with the yoke sitting higher on the bust. It helps hide bulges lower down (*ahem* waistline) and still flows wonderfully. It helped keep me cool on a hot Southern day this weekend. I'll definitely be ordering other colors, and ordering the long sleeve.",

It\u2019s got a really flattering neckline, then softly flows away from the sides. Nothing too flows, doesn\u2019t look maternity at all. I am 5\u20192\u201d, 160 and medium is perfect. I am muscular, with muscular arms, and the sleeves are great.However, all that said, my shirt came and I tried on quickly, hand washed and line dried, and wore the next day. Soon after putting it on I noticed a small fabric hole right on the boob. I emailed the company 4 days ago with no response. I have already worn and washed it, so I don\u2019t feel right returning it through amazon, but the company did zero to help. So, if you do order this, inspect it before you settle on it.UPDATE: CS got back to me and resent a new top. I plan on ordering a couple more colors, since I love the fit so much.",

The light brown was closer to a beige and the navy had a purple hue to it so it\u2019s not a typical navy.  The top is silky soft, light weight and comfortable.  Now my sister has purchased 2 as well.  Washes very nice, stays wrinkle free while wearing and the colors I\u2019ve purchased are not see through",
            "Very happy with it, pretty, soft. This shirt is so comfortable, and the fit is perfect. It\u2019s long enough to cover the belly. Front pleats are flattering with a nice drape. The material gives it a greater casual feel and makes it perfect for leggings!",

I wanted long layering tanks that have enough stretch for me to pull down from the top to allow me to breastfeed easily. I initially ordered size Medium thinking I would want a snug fit, but I found it was too snug for my liking and a little shorter than I was hoping. I actually benefited from a mistake where one of the tanks was a Large incorrectly tagged as a Medium, so I knew I liked the fit better! I returned the initial order, reordered size Large, and I absolutely love them! I've already worn them numerous times. They have good stretch, which allows me to nurse easily, and they're just the right length for me. The bottom hem falls right below the fullest part of my hips, just covering my butt.",

I got a medium. I am 5'10, 145lbs, and have a 28\" waist, 35\" hip, and 36D chest. I also love that the straps are adjustable. It can be hard to find tank tops for me because usually they are not long enough, and they have built-in bras, which annoy me since a lot of times the bra doesn't come down far enough to cover my chest. These tanks are very long and there is no shelf bra. I will definitely be ordering more in other colors, and I might try getting a small instead of a medium, too.",

Upon discovering they did not have a built in bra I was going to return them except they only accepted returns on the DAY OF ARRIVAL.  Okay, so I figure I will suck it up and just wear these for bed.  The first one I open the shoulder strap comes completely apart because it ISN\"T EVEN SEWN.  Total garbage.  The absolute worst.

Now I tried to order size L and M from seller ClothingAve. and they sent brands LaVictoria (size L) and Sofra (size M.) Both are 95% cotton, 5% spandex. But they feel very thin and scratchy. Definitely not the quality that the Active Basics brand is. They are also very tight fitting, like 1 size smaller. (For reference, I usually wear a M or L in tops depending on brand.) Appropriate for wearing to bed or underneath another shirt,  but I don't think I could wear them on their own. The LaVictoria camis are very long, which I prefer.  But then the straps are sewn on backwards so the adjustment part is on the front.  Don't like the look.  The Sofra camis are 4-5 inches shorter in length. So I am not happy with that either.  I'm keeping them cuz it's not worth my hassle trying to return. But I am not happy that I did not receive what was advertised, and I did not receive what I ordered.",

I thought this would help someone else who is interested in these camisoles as they are very comfortable and fit perfectly for me.  Not too tight but fit to my shape.  I expect my bust to get a little bigger once I've established breastfeeding which will be perfect because there's room to grow.  They cover my belly perfectly and they go just above my behind.  I have a little gather as I don't want to pull them straight down, but I'm sure they could go a little further.  The material is really comfortable and seems like a good quality.  I've not washed them yet, but if anything negative happens in the future, like broken strap or messed up in the wash, I will post again.  I will be buying more of these in the future, smaller size as my belly shrinks.  I hope this review is helpful to someone out there as I took a chance on ordering a 1X.  Most people only list how much they weigh, but that's not enough because we all carry our weight differently.  Thank you to those that did post their reviews as it helped me in choosing this product.",
            "This is the third time I have ordered these. The first time they were AMAZING! Great quality and fit. I loved them so much, I ordered another pack to have on hand when the first batch wore out. By the time I opened the second order to use, it was too late to return. I could immediately tell the fabric was different.  The brand was the same. Upon donning, they were ill fitting and I could feel the straps were sewed in at awkward places so didn't stay on shoulders. After one wear each, the straps came apart altogether.  Probably a year later, I decided to give them one more shot in hopes I would get some like the first order. Not only are these an entirely different brand but are even cheaper, thinner material and are very small. Straps are better positioned but not at all like the first order.",
            "I ordered the 4 pack of black in 2xl.  After washing all 4, I wore 2 with no issues.  When I went to grab one,  I thought that it had shrunk, however I looked and one of the tank tops was a size SMALL? just a little off from a 2xl..... Then today, I wore the 4th tank top and BOTH straps broke.  It's like the stitching on this particular tank top was poor quality.  I am only giving this a 3 because luckily I have had no issues with 2 out of the 4.",
            "I love these camis! I am 5'10\" tall and finding a cami that is long is a BOUNS! The fabric is soft. I really  like the satiny edge on the blue one( I kinda wish all were trimmed this way ). I have another pack on the way because I really like these. I got the medium. The straps do have the adjusters on them if you need that. Usually I use these as sleep ware, but occasionally I will wear them under a sweater or a button up and for yoga. I do think I will be ordering another pack next payday long camis are few and far between when you find 'em, buy 'em!The company was fast to respond to my inquiry. Stephanie was very helpful.",
            "I bought a mixed pack of blue, purple, black and \"emerald\" green. The green ended up being a super neon green, so I probably won't wear it, except maybe to sleep in.Other than that, these tank tops are fantastic. I'm 5'9 and very hourglass shaped, and no camis ever fit me without rolling, sliding and constantly needing to be adjusted, but these do. If anything, they're probably a little too long for most people, but I love them. I can tuck them in and they'll stay that way, under skirts, jeans, whatever. I'll definitely be buying more."

            "Super cute shirt! The waffle knit is really soft and comfy not scratchy at all. I ordered my size a large (I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d) and it fit like expected. It would be long enough to wear with leggings if you were a little shorter or sized up for a little longer or looser fit. The arm holes are not loose and don\u2019t show any bra. I would say it would be best to wear a white/nude bra or tank top under as the material is a tad see through. Would be so cute with shorts, jeans, or leggings.",
            "Love this tank for Spring/Summer. Material is really soft and breathable. The white was pretty see through but the pink/mauve wasn\u2019t. Got a lot of compliments. I\u2019m 5\u2019 1\u201d DD, wearing a small.",
            "This tank top is a must have! I read the reviews and checked the size chart and decided to go with my normal size Large ( I am 5'6\" and a US12), and it fit perfectly. No need to size up! It was looser in the tummy area and long (hit about 2-3 in past my hipbones) but the arm holes weren't so loose my bra showed. It wasn't sheer but a dark color bra could possibly show through. I'm going to order one in every color! I may order an XL in another color just to wear with leggings. The only thing to note is that I ordered the red color and what actually arrived was a very dusty purple/mauve color, but that's not a deal-breaker at all. I actually like the color MORE than the one that was pictured.",
            "The material is very soft and lightweight and I love the texture. It\u2019s perfect for any occasion, casual with shorts or dressy. The fit is perfect, accurate for your size.",
            "Very nice quality. I got a xl. I\u2019m 5\u201d8 175 36DD and I could have sized down to a large too. I\u2019ll buy this in other colors for sure!!",
            "Okay, let's get the obvious out of the way first. The tank top color is not red. Depending on the light, it's either dusty brick or burnt mauve. Based on another review I expected it and don't mind, but I do think the listing should be updated to accurately show and label the available colors. Otherwise, this twist knot waffle tank is so comfortable and looks cute with shorts and jeans. I have it in black also and personally, I couldn't commit to purchasing any of the light colors because the pattern allows for peeks skin through the fabric. The tank top is light on a hot day and I can see myself still wearing it into the fall under a cozy sweater. It should be noted that I haven't washed either of my tanks yet so I don't know how it holds up with laundering. I'm probably going to wash on delicate and flat dry rather than risk damage.",
            "Love this top so much, very classic and the fit is perfect. I'm 5'6\" around 170lbs and ordered a large.I plan on buying this in every color!",
            "So I always look at reviews before I buy something off of Amazon. And I really like when people say their sizes and whatnot. Well it didn't work out with this shirt at all. I am 5'8\" and about 150 pounds give or take and I ordered a large. This shirt was soooo big on me. I was literally swimming in this shirt. Besides the shirt not fitting, I love the style and feeling of the shirt. If this shirt actually would fit, I think I would really like this shirt. Hopefully this review will help you with your purchase!",
            "I would say if you're buying this shirt it is fitted, not loose fitting.  In the picture it looks like it was sized up a size.  I am a XL and I bought the XXL and it fits but it's not as loose as shown.  But the color and fabric is great.  I'll be buying more in different colors.  The fabric is thick and soft and you think you'd be too hot in it but you're not.  The front knot also came higher for me and I'm only 5'5 so if you're tall you might end up with a shirt that just meets the top of your pants in the front.",
            "This is very soft material, but a bit see through.  It runs way too big for me.  Style is cute, but a small fits like a medium on me."

            "OK, folks, I don't often leave product reviews, but the moment these amazing sandals/flip-flops were placed upon my feet, I swear I could hear my little tootsies SING!  I have plantar fasciitis, and so I need supportive, cushy footwear. My feet are also a bit on the chubby side, so I can't wear \"normal\" sandals because they are always too tight...which means I normally just have to settle for flip flops, which are not always the perfect match for the outfit and situation that I am in.These sandals are perfect! They look dressy enough to wear with a nice summery dress out to dinner, and yet not so stuffy that I couldn't throw on a pair of short and a t-shirt and head out to the park.  They are a DREAM to walk in!!! The \"strap\" material is stretchy enough to accommodate moving around and walking, and yet supportive enough to feel like these shoes won't fall off. They do give a very slight tug back into place, if that makes sense. The cushion is perfectly squishy without being too squishy - just enough squish for my plantar fasciitis to be happy walking in these all day. No, seriously...ALL DAY.I am currently wondering what is the appropriate amount of time to wait before I tell my husband that I'm buying several more pair in other colors? Psssshaw, I'm going to just go ahead and do it!! You should, too!I normally wear a 9 1/2 to a 10, depending on the brand of shoe. I got these in a 10 and they fit me perfectly with a little room past my toes and behind my heel, but that's how I like it. Sometimes when I'm sitting or walking in just the right way, my feet always tend to shift in whatever shoes I am wearing, so I like a little room to move around.p.s. I hate it when people leave reviews saying they got their stuff for free or discounted (and, gosh, why aren't companies offering ME free stuff or discounts, eh?!)...so I'm happy to report that I am a REAL person who paid full price for these. Worth every penny!",
            "Ok, I put these sandals through the ultimate test: Disney World.I'm overweight, and I don;t like closed shoes - my feet don't swell and aren't deformed or anything like that, I'm just accustomed to wearing sandals. So I started off in Magic Kingdom w/ my Addidas sneakers. This lasted a full two hours. I switched into my yoga slings and began to walk... and walk...and walk some more...and we walked until our backs were screaming. However, my feet were happy. Tired and achy, but NOTHING like what the sneakers or regular sandals do to your feet when you risk taking them to theme parks. That was day 1. Day 2, we went to Epcot - I wore my sandals ALL DAY LONG. I was the HAPPIEST in my group. No pain, walking was a breeze, and the head didn't make your feet sweat as much with these on. I wore them again on Day3...Ya'll, I've NEVER worn sandals to ANY theme park out fear of that burning sensation after walking too much. These are legit. I literally wear them for my daily walks, to the office, for errands, everything. I bought them in black and the sandy beige color and I will buy them in other funky colors as well. These are amazing! I cannot recommend these enough!",
            "I've been trying to avoid dropping $30 on a pair of flip flops but after searching tirelessly for something both cheap and comfortable with no luck, I finally broke down and got some yoga slings.  Ordered the same pattern in 2 different colors and absolutely love them!  I would prefer a little more arch support but overall they are very comfortable and super cute.I pretty consistently wear an 8.5 and after reading all of the reviews, I decided to order up and get a 9.  They seemed a bit big but I was leaving for the beach in just a few days, so I quickly ordered them in 8 and planned to return whichever didn't fit.  I snapped this photo of an 8 (back/left) and a 9 (front/right) in the hopes that it might help the other in-betweeners.  Maybe it's just because I have short toes but there was just too much extra space at the front for my liking.  The 8's fit great and the 9's were returned!",
            "I racked up a whopping 68 miles across six park days in Disney World wearing only these flip flops. My steps are often missed while I'm pushing the stroller so I'm sure there were even more miles than that. I always wear broken-in tennis shoes on big walking days and packed them with me just in case these flip flops didn't work out, but I never needed them! My feet normally get very hot and swell and I really hate wearing tennis shoes. I never wore these before our trip and was so happy there was no break in period at all. It even rained for hours on end one day and my feet were still comfortable in these. I just dried them with the hotel hairdryer that evening and wore them again the next day. The only time they were even the slightest bit uncomfortable was when my preschooler accidentally spilled orange juice on my feet and the piece between my toes got a tad sticky and rubbed. Fortunately it never caused a blister and once the fabric dried out, it was comfortable again. I would highly, highly, highly recommend these! These are going to be my forever disney, zoo day, travel, etc. shoes!! As for fit, I felt like these were a bit big. I usually wear a 7.5. I have pretty wide feet, so sometimes I need an 8 just because I need the width. I ordered an 8 in these since a half size wasn't available. The 8 felt fine enough to keep but if i order another pair, I believe I will go down to a 7.",
            "First off, if you're reading reviews of this product because you're considering purchasing a pair -- I can easily say just do it. These are great, comfy and adorable shoes.But I'm going to go against popular opinion here regarding going up or down for half-size people. I'm an 8.5 in everything -- boots, flats, pumps, trainers. Against my better judgement -- I followed the advice of other reviewers and went with a size down.When the shoes arrived I knew instantly that I loved them. However -- I had mixed feelings about the size. They fit -- but they *just* fit. When it comes to flip-flops I like a bit of overhand at the heel. Call it an OCD or whatever, but i like the shoe to extend ever-so-slightly from my heel.So I wrestled with what to do -- conquer my obsessive attitude and DEAL WITH IT or get a size 9.Not only did I buy a size 9 -- I bought two pairs in size 9.  AND they are PERFECT.I'm not returning the original size 8, either. I'm going to gift them to my sister who wears a 7.5 -- I just know she'll love these too.",
            "I have 4 pair of Sanuk Yoga Slings. I love them that much!! I normally wear a 7 1/2 shoe and I took the advice to order a size 8 since they don't come in half sizes. Good advice!! They fit perfectly!",
            "I am normally a 7 1/2 in sandals. I ordered a 7 and hey fit perfectly.These shoes are so comfortable and I wear them everywhere.Work, class, shorts, dress.I adore them. I plan on buying a few more in different colors and patterns.",
            "I love, love, love these! I was worried about how they'd look on my feet, I have chubby feet, but they feet like a glove. They are great. And oohh so comfortable! I originally bought them as beach shoes but, I'm not gonna lie, I'm gonna wear them all the time!",
            "Love these sandals.  I am annoyingly someone with hyperhidrosis so my feet sweat like a running faucet and I can never wear rubber flip flops without sliding out of them, they just make my feet sweat more.  I know, sounds gross and embarrassing.  We do go on vacation to lots of warm places, and who wants to wear socks and shoes with dresses everywhere you go??  Not me!  These sandals are amazingly comfortable for walking, my feet don\u2019t get sweaty, they are super cute, and they fit just fine.  I wear a size 11 (I know I know, big sweaty feet\ud83d\ude30) and the size 11 fits just fine.  Pretty. Stinkin. Happy!",
            "I bought these shoes to take to Barcelona Spain for a week vacation.  I am a size 6.5 in the majority of shoes I wear aside from running shoes (size 7).  I bought the size 6 and they fit perfectly.  The straps were easy to put on and the soles are very comfortable.  I wore them all day yesterday and walked approximately 5 miles around Dallas, TX with no blister and very happy feet.  I would highly recommend these!"

            "Super cute shirt! I ordered the forest green and it is a beautiful color. It has the split right at the hip and covers your bum so you can wear leggings with it (score!) The back is a little longer than the front. I ordered a medium and it is a loose-fitting medium on me (I usually wear M-L depending on brand). Very soft and comfy!",
            "I love these, soft, not clingy and not running small at all - I am currently between a size 10 and 12 and the Medium fits me loosely, flattering.  Tail is  longer in the back.  I will order more, they are thin but not \"see through\" and do not stick to your curves, the fabric flows.  Also, I am not a small-boned woman, nor young and sinew-y",

Didn't shrink after wash either! I am 5'5 and 150 lbs and ordered a large and normally can wear a either a medium or large depending on the style shirt. It fit a little loose just how I wanted it to! I ordered the black and the army green and they turned out great! Definitely buying the other colors for future shirts!",
            "So glad to have tried this, I ordered it in white which is a very stark white. I'm a 40C and ordered a medium instead of my usual large. Wish I would've ordered a small due to the 5% spandex in the fabric that causes a lot of give in the bustline. Its a great top! I noticed from the pictures that the slit is different for some. I'm grateful I have a ling enough slit that makes this high low top perfect for skinnies or leggings. Shop away!",

I do like the green color - it's very unique - not too bright. I am keeping it because it fits, I'm just disappointed it isn't over-size as described. I would probably have to get the XL for it to fit like the picture. it is comfortable for a regular t-shirt.  If it were over-size, I would give it 5 stars.",

Ordered the same shirt in the maroon- in the same size -and it is one full inch smaller. I also ordered the green and they sent a different shirt.Would really love to have the same shirt as my blue one in different colors, skins over my waist and hips in a very flattering way.",

However, since I carry more weight in my stomach it does make that area more noticeable, whether it's because of the fabric or just the way it hangs on my body.

Which is brighter in the sun than the ad picture. Inside lighting the burgandy is similar to the ad picture. I also bought black and blue.It is thin material, but I like that in hot Southern Ca weather. Soft, cotton blend, but not see through. Nice for layering warmer clothing over it.The cut is nice, I think. The V-neck. which is not too low, is always flattering and shows off a nice necklace well.I washed in cold and hung to dry. Shrinkage was minimal, if any.One thing I do not like it the scratchy, stiff tag sewn into the side seam, most sensitive waist area. Cut out right away. That is common in clothing, so I wouldn't take a star away for that, but would request that the manufacturer sew the tag in at the hip instead.The TAG READs: \"95% Cotton, 5% Spandex. made in CHINA\"\"wash with like colors. dry clean recommended\"",

I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d 145lbs and wear a 32C bra and I got a medium. It was fitted around my busy and arms which I like!",

I think this says a lot about their brand. Very nice people.I definitely didn\u2019t get the same shirt as advertised. I also didn\u2019t realize this was a microfiber-ish material when I ordered it. I usually wear a small, but got a medium in this shirt. It was very tight around my stomach and was not flowy at all. It hugged around my waist and I was hoping for more coverage around my butt.",
            "Sleeves are not as shown. The picture shows a slightly longer sleeve, and in other reviewer\u2019s pictures I see some did get the longer sleeve. I did not. This is a standard short sleeve that just barely covers the shoulder.  It also fits weird. Big and boxy (everywhere, including the neck, which causes it to slide around and look sloppy.) It\u2019s also much shorter than pictured and the material shows every imperfection. I alsways wear a camisole under my shirts and this shirt shows every single seam, bump and ripple from the cami, the bra and any extra pudge you may have under it. This is not worth more than $5.  For reference, I am 5\u20194\u201d, 126lbs and I ordered the small in white."

I couldn't leave it on for more than 2 mins without being completely agitated. The sleeves fell at a really weird place on my arms. It's a v neck and in my (probably a bit conservative) opinion, is cut a little too deep. The print was really the problem. It was too low on the shirt. It sort of sat toward the mid stomach area. I intended to wear this with a maxi skirt, but I could only see \"Be\" because \"kind\" was completely covered by the skirt. The material of the shirt and the yellow color was alright though.",

            "This is my favorite style of Columbia shirt! I have it in white and clear blue, and can't wait to buy more. The colors are fantastic, and the fit is tailored nicely for females. The snap buttons make it a quick shirt to throw on, and super simple to roll or unroll the sleeves. The shirt itself is super thin and keeps you cool, while also providing excellent sun protection. I always wear one when kayaking, fishing, crabbing, etc. and never get sun burned. For size reference, I bought an XS and am 5'5\" and 120 lbs. The XS isn't too snug, and allows me extra room to move my arms around comfortably. In the picture, I'm wearing the XS white shirt. My friend is a couple inches taller and is wearing a S in cool blue. If you want a good looking, cool, sun protectant shirt, this is definitely worth a purchase.",
            "True to size, very thin, not too hot (I live in nm and it was 98 with no wind yesterday). Great shirt will be buying more. I have a Large chest 38DD, and the XL does not have the dreaded button Gap",
            "I ordered this shirt but ended up returning it for a few reasons. 1) There are no buttons, only white plastic snaps. To me this cheapens the look. I worry about the white plastic yellowing over time or the shirt popping open on me. 2) I ordered white because I thought it would look really fresh and cool. While I liked white, it was extremely sheer in the parts not lined with mesh. The lower back especially would show any tattoo, mole, bandaid etc. I think if you wore it really roomy, that would be okay but I was looking for a more fitted look.",
            "Was lost in the woods for 12 hours in this shirt. Had to slide down a mountain in it. The evidence of my slide has not completely washed out of the back, only negative. I started out with it snapped up, sleeves down and ended up with it unsnapped, sleeves up. After hiking for 12 hours in it with few stops I had no chaffed areas. If fits close like a hiking shirt should. I'm a bit hippy so things from North Face in a 12 were too slim. The woman in the store told me I needed to look at Columbia so I came home and looked on Amazon. I leave the bottom snap unsnapped just because I don't like things too snug. I'm going to hike to the bottom of the  Grand Canyon in a few days and I will not take another shirt. I'll rinse this one out that night and wear it back out the next day. It dries quickly and I washed it in the washing machine and dried it on a hanger. The stain on the back is proof that I can survive in the deep woods. I will be 69 on June 3rd.",
            "I have some Columbia Bahama button up shirts &amp; wear a medium in those (I'm 5;7\" 165 lbs), which may run slightly large, but in this shirt I get a large and it fits perfectly, very flattering fit and I still have some room to move. Love the yellow color, bright and vibrant, but if you don't like flashy colors you'll feel like you're wearing a banana Laffy Taffy wrapper.I am a biological technician doing field work. Between the Tamiami and the Bahama, the Tamiama is more lightweight, which is nice if it's hot out, but snags more easily and therefore doesn't hold up well if you're doing daily field work in shrubby areas.",
            "It is very cute, but the Medium fit me like a Large.  I then ordered it in SM, arrived just now, and it's perfect! Still plenty of room to cross arms, since the back ventilation \"shawl\" is roomy--it does come down farther than most shirts like this, but seems more stylish.Big plus: FINALLY a roll-up sleeve that covers more like a 3/4 sleeve (for the M, just below the elbow for the S).  Most hit above elbow and are NOT flattering!The \"fossil\" color is sort of like the old Necco chocolate flavor wafer candy.  Will not show dirt much.The \"button-down collar\" uses velcro so tips can be easily opened to lay spread out.There are TWO zippered pockets near the waist.  These will be fabulous for travel.  (PS I threw away one shirt--another brand--that had chest pockets.  Unusable because they make you look lumpy, VERY unflattering, and if you tried to unbutton some top buttons, the mesh lining hung out like bad underwear.)AND the \"Columbia\" tag is velcro-ed so that it could hold a water tube or lip-balm.  LOVE this shirt!",
            "Polyester ripstop is my favorite material for shirts.  I have so many varieties of this style across several brands.  The material keeps you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  The material is soft, washes well, retains its color and doesn't wrinkle.  You can wear this shirt to the office and then step on a hiking trail after work without changing.  The sleeves fit well both rolled up or unraveled. A mesh flap in the back provides for ventilation.  These make great travel shirts because of the low maintenance.  Wash and ring them out and they dry out in a few hours.There are two side pockets above the hips for perhaps small wallet or phone or keys.  The pockets are a bit out of the way so as to not create bulk across the chest.I picked the vibrant rose red and will soon get other colors.  I noticed a large difference in price between the colors.",
            "This was my second columbia shirt that I purchased from amazon the first being a different material...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089FB73W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1I LOVE this shirt. The material is super soft and fast drying. I order the medium in the other style and it fit really big. The small fits perfect! I am 5'6\" and around 135lbs I would recommend the small vs. medium.",
            "I have almost every color. Things I really like are: lightweight, easy to wash and I hang dry, you really stay dry (and I tend to sweat alot and easily), the colors are really nice, roll up into a small ball (great when traveling), they are very complimentary in looks. I also like the snaps --when you roll up the sleeves they stay up well, i.e.  do not unroll in places where the snap band isn't present.I am a curvy size 12/14 and the X-large fits great, the tailored fit is particularly nice without being snug at all.Now the BUT part ---- if you get the lighter colors // like yellow it is somewhat see through -- so I add a thin cami----which then + to the retaining of any sweat, not a big deal for me as I love these shirts.",
            "Bright, lightweight. Fits perfectly. All as described. Washes well. Took it on a boat trip to the Caribbean. Will definitely buy more."

            "Phone doesn't look as sleek in the case, but how could it? Color and looks show through well. Bumpers on top and bottom protect well against a drop. No raised bumpers on sides, so it is possible for my phone to fall screen first.",
            "I was really excited to get my first OtterBox for an affordable price. The only thing is, as you can see in the pictures, the border/bumper of the case yellows EXTREMELY fast. I've only had the case for a little over a month and it's already turned yellow. I've ordered cheaper, clear cases that don't even yellow that fast. So it's something to be aware of before you purchase. If the discoloration doesn't bother you then by all means purchase it because the case is very durable, after all it is an OtterBox.",
            "I really like the case but it did not fit my phone so I returned it.  Not the seller's fault......I didn't pay attention and ordered the S9 instead of S9+.  It was delivered very quickly and I received my refund promptly.",
            "I received on June 1, I have now had to file an Otterbox claim as the case is scratched but more importantly the back of my phone is shattered.  This case did NOT protect my phone when dropped.",
            "I mostly love this case! Great design, easy to put on and take off, doesn't interfere with buttons, in other words a great otterbox case. However when it does get scratches it seems to scratch quite deeply. The edges also have picked up a dirty looking blue from living in my back pocket, and the rubbery material makes it impossible to clean (if anyone has tips I'd love to hear them!). The phone is also more exposed due to the curved edges, so the 2 or 3 times I've dropped my phone the phone edge has caught and cracked my glass screen protector (previous phone and otterbox was for the S7 with a full edge wrap/ more protection)",
            "I love how it gives my screen a bumper zone if dropped face down, easy to put on, works with screen protector, and is wireless charger compatible",
            "Probably the lightest of the OtterBox series, This case will give you OtterBox protection with half the weight. The sides come up higher Knouff to protect the curved screen address and your screen protector. Particularly if you were using a ZAGG SCREEN PROTECTOR which has a tendency to crack if an edge touch is a hard flat surface.",
            "Buttons are very stiff which makes it hard to lock/unlock the phone or use the volume buttons.",
            "I've had this less than two months and the clear is already yellowing. I specifically bought it because I thought it would stay nicer for longer. Very disappointed in this case, not worth the extra money.",
            "Fit well, Clear Case, does not block the Biometric button on lower back side of Galaxy S9 I recommend this case.."

            "Great shirt for the price. I was skeptical at first but decided to give them a try and I was really impressed. I went up a size...I'm usually a medium but went up to a large since the reviews I read suggested to go up in size. It fits just right. Here are a few pictures of different angles of what the shirt looks like on.I love the length... it offers coverage for curvy women like myself.I'm 150lbs 5ft 4in.",
            "This shirt is awesome!! I'm 5'4 and 165 pounds. The fabric is soft and the cutouts are cute on the sleeve. I didn't wash it before I wore it and the only thing bad I would say about this is that some of the dye came off on my skin.",
            "This shirt is cute. I am 5'3 170lbs size 11/12. I usually order a Large but I ordered a size up, an XL, and it fits me fine. It hasn't been washed or Dried yet, so I wish it were a tad bit longer. Overall, a worthwhile purchase.",
            "Shirt is great, very lovely fits like a charm, would have preferred a little bit looser of a shirt but not a big deal. What is a big deal and i don't know if it's the shirt I received or all shirts come like this but this shirt bleeds color like crazy, my arms, bra, undershirt, anything this shirt came in contact with transferred color.I passed the shirt through the washer and even after that it still bleeds, can you imagine the embarrassment I had to go through when i went to have my blood drawn when the lab lady passed the alcoholic napkin and it was all dark and dirty from the shirt I had on. I had to explain myself as to why my arm was so dirty because of this shirt. I ordered a different shirt in burgundy color hopefully that one doesn't bleed as the black one does.If it wasn't for the color bleeding i would have given it a 5 star rating.Here i added a few of my personal favorite pics of me being silly but also of the outcome of wearing this shirt.The shirt tag is dirty and so is my bra straps which won't wash out no matter the number of washes i do. Where was this shirt made?",
            "Love this shirt! Made well for the price, not skin tight but flattering. I bought a small &amp; it's just long enough for leggings. To help with measurements I'm 5'2 115 1lbs. Definitely buying this again.",
            "Fits very comfortably! 5'6 about 170 pounds and a large is perfect, not too tight not too lose :) decently made as well",
            "I am about 145 lb, 5\u20197\u201d, wait 34 in, bust 38in, hips 40 inch.. I ordered a Large. it fits loose, but that is how it i. it covers my but, a little long but that is the style. I could have ordered one size smaller for tighter fit.",
            "It's so  comfortable",
            "I bought the white and red colors. This review will talk about the colors, the fit and matching to your bra.Colors: The white was a bit more see-through than I was hoping. It didn't show my bra, but it did show the line of my pants. So it isn't super thin, but I wish it was just a bit more opaque. And the red is not a deep red, but a super bright orangy red. So if you want a bright red - this red is for you. But if you are hoping for a darker/deeper red, like you see in the photo, then I would pass on the red.Fit: I read in other reviews to size up.  I am normally a L or XL. (6' tall, size 12-14) So I bought the red in XL and I liked the fit. I also bought the white in XL and XXL. I don't think I have ever purchased an XXL before because they are normally huge, but I wanted the white to be \"flowy\" over my belly. This XXL in white was not overly huge and did float over my belly in a nice way - and at 6' tall it was perfectly long enough. But I could see it being too long on someone else.Bra: I choose white and red shirts because I have white and red bras - and I figured that the bra strap would coordinate nicely with the shirt. So, when deciding which color shirt to buy, you may want to think about your bra. Plan that the strap will show and you may want to match the bra and shirt - or wear a strapless bra.In sum - this shirt is cute and at a great price! But I would probably get the black next time since the red was too bright, the white was a bit too thin and I have a black bra. I hope this is helpful to you.",
            "Size ordered: SMeasurements: 5'2\" tall, 102lbs, 32DDD bust, size 0-2 pants, usually S/M topsI bought both the wine red and blue colors and the colors are true to the photos and very pretty, however I feel like they fit like mediums when they are actually smalls. The sleeves fit me loose, the length is longer than I expected, and it is no where near tight on my torso like it seemed to be on others, but overall I am still very pleased with the quality of them and I like the look, but I think an XS would have worked better for me if it existed."

            "I first gave this shirt a 1 Star, because The side cut showed unlike the picture shows and also fits one size too small. After reviewing the product I called amazon and asked for a return label. I immediately got a call from the seller who said they were sorry I was unhappy with my purchase and would send me a size up free of charge, they also asked if there was anything else I could recommend. First of all Amazon refunded my money, so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything better then that. This seller went out of their way to make sure I was happy. I told them I should have purchased a size up and in black instead of silver bc the nursing slit may have been more camouflaged. They are sending me a larger black shirt for free.Update: rcvd my new shirt in black, LOVE IT!!!! Very comfortable and easy to nurse. Buy a size up.",
            "It's stylish I like the way it looks on. The only downfall is the material is that kind that shows when you get just a little wet so not the best for breastfeeding if you happen to leak or when you're burping your baby in the light color shirt like the turquoise it will definitely stand out. Or if you are sweating a lot your SOL. But if you go with a black color you should be good. last downfall is the material snags easily I have a few already and I just opened it out of the bag. Other than that is super soft material that looks good when there's not many options out there I'm happy. Easy functioning when use for breastfeeding.",
            "I love this shirt. I bought one while I was pregnant and it fit the whole time (large; 5'7\" 150lbs pre-pregnancy, 180lbs full term). I just bought a second one for breastfeeding- it is so discreet and camouflages my post-pregnancy belly. *Photo is from when I was 7 months pregnant.",
            "I ended up buying 5 of these shirts so I can easily pump at work. YOU CAN ACCESS BOTH BREASTS AT THE SAME TIME TO PUMP! Very easy to feed baby discretely through the shirt as well. Very comfortable, lightweight, flowing material. Very happy with the product, highly recommend!",
            "I love this shirt! I bought lavender and mint, loved it so much I bought the blue and coral ones. It is loose in the right places for my postpartum body, and is fitted through the bust just enough to make you feel feminine. It is also very easy for nursing, just move the fabric to the side, no buttons, and there isn't an ocean of fabric to get tangled in.",
            "This is my first piece of \"nursing wear\" and I love it!! I am 5'8 around 155-60 lbs and I ordered a size small and it fits well. Many nursing tops are very obviously for nursing and this one is a little bit more discreet. If you are really modest, you will probably still want to use a nursing cover, but you can definitely don't need it- this shirt will cover almost everything. I plan on wearing this when we take our baby on his first plane ride so I can nurse discreetly on the plane.",
            "This is a great nursing top!Pros: doesn't look like a nursing top. The black color hides the vertical side seams that pull towards the center of the shirt to allow for discrete nursing. Material is good quality, washes and dries nicely- didn't shrink or change from washing. Long, almost tunic length is very flattering.Con: the tiny, tiny gripe I have is that the arm holes are a little bit loose which shows your bra. Other than that this is a perfect shirt and I've ordered it in other colors too.",
            "I wore this shirt most days this summer, no one can typically even tell that I am nursing which is why I like it better than most other nursing tops I wear. I don't need to mess with putting a blanket or hooter hider over. I can even nurse in church and party settings very discreetly. Normally men wouldn't stand and talk to me if they knew I was nursing, but they just think I'm holding the baby with this shirt.I bought it in another color! For my first purchase, I bought a medium which fit perfectly right after the baby was born, but I feel like 3 months out it was a little too big so I got a small for the second shirt and it's perfect. 5'9\", 170 lb.Only con for me is that it stains so easily. At this point even fresh out of the wash, it looks stained. But, I'm not real worried about that.",
            "My pre-pregnancy size is a medium, and I purchased a size medium in yellow and black.  The tops fit as I expect a US size medium nursing top to fit (maybe a little more fitted than on the model, but it wasn't too clingy on me).  The fabric is a soft, thin, drapey, rayon-type material, which is so nice for spring and summer.  I plan on wearing these tops in the fall and winter under my cardigans as well. I like how the armholes are cut - they don't show my bra straps on my shoulders or my bra under my arm.  I washed and dried the black one in the dryer and it did not shrink. The yellow color isn't see-through with a nude bra, but both tops do show some lumps and bumps due to the type of material. I haven't had any milk or spit-up stains on the tops yet to know if they permanently stain as other reviewers have stated.  I will definitely purchase more colors and check out other nursing styles from Smallshow!",
            "Bought four different colors for my daughter - they arrived today - she loves them!  They are exactly what she needed; comfortable, discreet, easy, and soft material that doesn't bother the baby.  Three cheers for finding something awesome!  My daughter is around 5'8\" and 220 lbs; the XL is perfect and even a bit loose."

It maintains its fit no matter how many days you wear it or how often to wash it. This might go down as my favorite find on Amazon!! When in it has the look of a higher style of T. Not some cotton thing you find at the super market.",

The most significant thing I can say is that this particular color is made of a different fabric than all the others and the cut (much longer) and sizing (runs small) are also different. It's nice, but definitely prefer the others over this one. They are more flattering and are made well. This one is cute for sure,  but the fabric is a little thin.",

            "These are exactly what I was looking for! I wanted a pair of shorts that had a 5\" inseam that were loose fitting and easy to move around in. I was worried that the inseam would be too short, that the waistband would be too tight and uncomfortable. I hate when I'm wearing shorts and the inseam is too short or the leg is too tight and the legs ride up. I love that these are simple. I bought a L and am 5'1\" 180lbs. The waist band is PERFECT it's not too tight and isn't falling off of my waist. The short length goes slightly past my finger tips and it doesn't hug my legs. I really aprreciate when people mention their measurements as it helps those who use reviews to figure out how they'd measure up too. I will continue to buy these \u2764\ufe0f",

Ordered XL, my waist is 36, hips 44, and even though the XL fits, I would probably order L next time because they're a bit big. I know they're supposed to be loose on you anyhow, but i can order a size down and still be safe. The XL would probably even fit someone with a 40-44*** waist, because the waistband has a lot of stretch.*** i'm guestimating hereOK, just measured and i was right. i stretched out the waistband of the XL to capacity and it measured 48 inches. So if you're a bigger person and, following the image supplied, you know the part of body the waist band will fall on will measures 48 or less, go ahead and buy.They reach me about 4-5 inches above the knees. I'm short...5'1\"",
            "This is my third pair of these shorts, which should tell you how much I like them! The only thing they're missing is pockets; other than that, they're perfect.I'm 5'9\" and about a size 12 or 14 (42-33-42), and I get these in XXL because I can't stand tight clothes. These give me lots of stretch, they don't fall down or ride up, and they're a nice length (I never have to pull these down). I normally can't stand to sleep in bottoms of any kind, and I can comfortably sleep in these (and have many times).My previous pairs are still going strong after MANY trips through the washer and dryer, so the quality is pretty great, too.",
            "Although the color, quality and material are fine, these shorts were specifically purchased based on the article description stating that they have a 5 inch inseam, which they clearly do not.  Having measured them, they should properly be described as having a 2.5 inch inseam. Too short for someone is who is quite tall.(5'8\")",
            "Love these! They are so comfortable and cute. I\u2019m 5\u20193 145lbs and I ordered a medium. Will be repurchasing.",
            "Perfect for shorts for lounging or working out at home. I was looking for shorts that would allow movement and not ride up or constrict in the crotch area (ladies you know what I mean). These are soft, they fit well, wash well no lose threads. I happy with them and intend to purchase more. I ordered a size med based on the size info provided and they fit perfectly I am 5'5 129. Highly recommend if you are looking for a casual short. Arrived timely.",
            "Shorts that don't roll up to my bum! Based on the reviews originally I ordered a medium in the dark grey, I'm 5'2\" 136 lbs  and wear a size 10 in bottoms and have an hour glass figure. The material is definitely what I consider sleep wear, at least for the grey and the medium wasn't large enough, I was constantly pulling them down. So I ordered the black because they're mostly cotton, got them in a large and was hoping the fit would be more to my liking.  Not so much sadly. They roll right up to the very top of my leg. Even when I wear them to just water the flowers in the morning I'm tugging them down and unrolling. Frustrating.  Other than that, at least the waist band is comfortable and I like the black far better because of the cotton content.",
            "I'm going to order more.I am 5'4 weigh 160.Wear a 12.Have fuller tummy and thinner legs.I am 55.About an inch longer for my age would have been nice, but I pull them down a little on my hips.Bought to wear to the gym, and wear them as a summer version of sweat pants!"

            "This tank top is very cute. It is well made and a bit of a thicker material. I read that one some reviews and wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. The material is not see thru. It is heavier material than a cami. The tank top is nice quality with a vibrant pink and black and white stripes. The picket is a kind of crocheted material and adds nicely to the tank. I am 5\u20196\u201d and weigh about 200 lbs. I purchased an XL and it fit nicely.",
            "This shirt is great, I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing and seemed there was different comments on size.  After lots of consideration I went with my normal size, medium.  This was a great choice as the medium fit great and had the nice \"flowy\" feel that the product picture shows.  Just for comparison, I am 5'8\" and weigh about 145, I ordered a medium.The material is soft and not cheap looking or feeling either.  great price and shirt.",
            "Love the shirt, it's super soft and comfortable. I sized up per others review, but wish I didn't. Normally I wear a large in women's which is what I bought. I would've been more comfortable in a medium as I was looking for a tighter fit, but if you like loose shirts this is perfect.For reference I'm 5'3 and 160# 38DD 34\" waist and I have a pretty short torso.",
            "Very pretty, well made top.  The material is that weird shiny, thinner fabric that snags easily but it is made well enough that it doesn't rip.  Colors are as advertised but does run a touch small.",
            "This product is bigger than expected, so I'm glad I listened to the reviews and got a small. I'm 5'4\" 130 pounds and usually get mediums, but I got the small and it fits well. It's kind of long so I'm my opinion it looks weird with shorts, but it will be cute with some leggings!",
            "I really like the look of this shirt, and the fact that it's cute and casual. I followed the fit guide and ordered an XL (I'm 5'7\" 165, smaller chest but long torso; I'm usually a M Tall or L) and the fit is great, except for under the arms, where it gaps out a bit. Not terrible, as I don't walk around with my arms out so people can see, but it is noticeable when I raise my arms. Other than that, I love it!",
            "Bought the pink in Large. I'm between a Medium &amp; Large in tops. With a tank top I'll buy Medium for more of a fitted look and Large if I want an oversized look. I bought Large in this for oversized look and I LOVE it! It's the perfect length and width. I'm not typically a pink kind of girl but I have tons of blue things and I liked the black but really like color so I let my husband decide and he went with pink. I'm so glad I did because it's such a nice bright pink that'll go great with denim. I'm excited for warmer weather when I'll be able to wear it. I have washed it and hung dry (only because I was going to bed and wouldn't be able to check dryer) and it washed really well and hung with no wrinkles once dry.",
            "I like this shirt and keep wearing it. However, the perfectionist in me is really bothered by the fact that the stripe pattern is sown slightly lopsided. It's almost imperceptible and, unless someone is staring directly at my chest, they wouldn't notice that the top black line is tilted where it meets the salmon top. So, if you're looking for top quality, this might not be your top, but it is pretty cute despite its imperfection.",
            "The shade of blue was much different in person compared to the pictures online but still super cute (you can see in the pictures I added)! I would say it runs very true to size. It is not a racer back, so you can wear a regular bra with it no problem. I did wear a cami underneath it because my bra could be seen a little bit through the tank material. You can see the cami in some of the pictures. Overall super cute and a great price!",
            "First time wearing it, so I haven\u2019t washed it. The material feels like it will shrink, so I\u2019ll make sure not to dry it. I am a 36B or 34C chest size. Bought a medium. I actually really love this shirt.It would be cute with leggings too...perfect length."

I went to eat, dance and Walmart and probably got 20 compliments!\ud83d\ude0a I have posted a video from my ballroom class to see how lovely this dress moves while dancing.. this is without a petticoat but I plan to wear one in the future. Looks great with or without one! Just in this video I have paired it with a black belt instead of the bow that comes with it, as that is in my hair :) I have been ballroom dancing just since march 24 of this year and this is a waltz :) hope this review helps anyone trying to decide \ud83d\ude0a",

My bust is 38G and I\u2019m presently at 211.2lbs. As I have a large hip, I can get away with wearing the dress with or without the underskirt. My hubby voted for me wearing the underskirt today. It is 26 inches long and light-weight.The price for this dress is unbeatable and it is well worth it!  I love it so much that I bought it in many other colors and prints. I recommend this dress!!!"

            "Last year, I bought a number of Under Armour clothing and since then, Under Armour has become my favorite workout clothing brand! I love the quality of the clothes, color selection, and how they are designed to keep you cool (or warm, depending on the line). I decided to get some more workout shirts this year and wanted to try some with a pattern rather than just the solid shirts, since I have some of those already. I didn't have any of the Twist Tech shirts and decided to give them a try.This Under Armour Twist Tech shirt is part of Under Armour's HeatGear line, which is designed to keep you cool in warm weather. This shirt is considered a LOOSE fit, which means you will most likely want to purchase a smaller size for a more comfortable fit. The shirt has a flattering V-neck cut and has a twisted, or heathered, pattern that makes it different than a solid color shirt. These shirts are made in Jordan of 100% polyester. Washing instructions say to wash with similar colors. I always put these in the washing machine on a normal cycle, hang them up to dry, and I've never had a problem with shrinking.I initially purchased one of these shirts to make sure I had the right size and loved it so much I ordered two more! For size reference, I am 5'6\", 165 pounds, with a 36D chest and some extra belly fat from my twin pregnancy and I purchased a medium. I typically wear a medium or large in shirts and, since this shirt is a loose fit, I went with the medium and it fits perfectly! These shirts are so comfortable and I wear them a lot for working out. They keep me as cool and dry as possible (of course, I still sweat). They wash up well and I am also able to wear them for everyday wear with yoga pants. My mom is in her early 60s and wears these shirts for everyday wear, along with under her scrubs for work. She loves them as much as I do and wants to get some more! The fit is nice and comes down to the top of my rear, which is just how I like. I purchased the colors Pink Shock/Metallic Silver, Mediterranean/Metallic Silver, and Absinthe Green/Metallic Silver and I'm considering purchasing a couple more.I love these shirts and feel they are great for working out or for everyday wear. Please note, this shirt is a LOOSE fit so you will want to purchase a smaller size for a more flattering fit. I'd say if you have two sizes of shirts you normally wear, purchase the smaller size for this shirt. The shirt is nice enough to wear in public and I also purchased\u00a0Under Armour Women's Armour Mid Sports Bra, Pink Shock/Rhino Gray, Large\u00a0so I could color-coordinate with my shirts. I love these shirts and highly recommend them!",
            "I'm 5'6 195 and ordered two of the XL. The fit is perfect and form fitting, not lose and not tight and that's how I wanted it. I just hope it doesn't shrink much. I'm normally an XL or XXL on Amazon. I read reviews so I knew it should fit me because it's a lose fit shirt so order a size down if you want it to be a form fit. My only complaint is that it shows my tummy bulge more then I would like. It's still flattering and cool/comfortable. I would like to get more in a larger size to have less tummy bulge and allow for shrinkage but they don't have an XXL.. It's still pretty flattering. The peach looks really pretty on me and shows my tan more.",
            "I'm 5'5\" (168cm), 27.5' waist and ordered S. I was expecting semi-fitted but it happened to be a loose fit.As a loose fit, I chose the right size because it looks exactly like the model in the picture. Never snug around my waist.S is good for running but XS would have been better for weight training.(Size S width: chest 47cm, hem 51cm/ sleeve : 16cm/ length : 67cm)I learned that I should check the fit on the UA website before I buy.",
            "I have four of these shirts and absolutely love them! They work great for all-day wear and hold up very well during my sweaty weightlifting sessions (1.5-2 hours long). My favorite feature of these shirts would have to be their ability to make you appear less sweaty than you actually are. As someone who does power lifting, Olympic lifting, and cardio in a non-air conditioned warehouse in the South, having a t-shirt that doesn't appear soaked in sweat, and doesn't showcase big armpit sweat stains (those are the worst), ten minutes into your workout, is a miracle. It also helps that these shirts are breathable and quick to dry. After each workout, I hand-wash the shirt with a little bit of soap, gently squeeze out the water from the shirt, put it on a hanger, and hang it from my shower head to dry - that way, I don't have to buy a week's worth of shirts or do the laundry every other day.Aside from functionality, the t-shirt, for me, fits as expected and per the size chart. I tend to prefer looser-fitting shirts and size medium, for my 34C-bra size, long torso - I'm 6 ft, and swimmer's shoulders (much broader than average), fits perfectly. I don't find these shirts to be transparent at all - I can wear a bright, different-colored sports bra underneath and it doesn't show through. The colors I have are vivid and bright as well (Cobalt, Water, Dynamo Blue, and Mega Magenta).I would definitely recommend Under Armour Women's Tech Twist V-Neck to anyone, especially those who participate in a sweat-prone activity or live in a hot, humid climate!",
            "I recently started running (been a bit over 2 months) and I purchase more and more appropriate clothing. I came across this one and really liked the look and the price so decided to try it out. I am about 165 Ibs (75 kg) and 5'2\"(158 cm) and the medium size first me very well.The shirt is very lightweight and comfortable. It doesn\u2019t take in much sweat and dries out fairly quickly, which is very handy with my hour long exercise sessions. I owe a gray one, and it is not transparent at all.I have had this shirt for a bit over 3 weeks, absolutely love it and workout with it almost every day. So far I have no complaints at all, but will update if I get any! Absolutely recommend!",
            "Loose fit. I'm  usually a medium. I Need a small. Would have been fine if the description said loose fit. Product itself is 5 stars gave 4 because lack of info on description.",
            "Just received today.  Very happy.  Ordered XL and typically wear a L or XL.  It is roomy but in a good way.  Definitely not too big.  Very nice material and feels like it will be good for hot and humid days.",
            "This is my go-to T-shirt now for the gym. I love it. It's been washing up beautifully. I intentionally got it a little large so I would have full range of motion in my arms for working out. It's clearly a quality product; well constructed, excellent material.",
            "This is a great athletic shirt. The material is silky soft and very flattering. I wish I had listened to the other reviews about the loose fit of this shirt. I normally wear a medium and wish I had ordered a small in this particular style. I\u2019m keeping the medium because it\u2019s fine but a small would have been better. Otherwise I\u2019m verg pleased with this purchase.",

            "This is a good, high quality, casual shirt. The fabric is soft and feels well made. I purchased the Apricot color. It is more of a warm, soft, golden yellow than it appears in the photo. It is a beautiful color. The fabric is a bit thin, and see-theough, so I need to wear a camisole under. I wish it were thicker, but that is my only complaint.",
            "I purchased this because I have been looking for tops that have REAL fabric in them.  Most women's tops have polyester, nylon, rayon, acrylic, spanx and other names the industry have created to call fabric that's not fabric.  These are petroleum-based manufactured fibers.  This top is not 100% petroleum but it, in my research of looking for ones with more real fabric this worked.  It's 97%cotton, 3%spandex but that 3% gives the top a lot of stretch.Another reason I purchased this is I was looking for a top that breathed.  The fake fabric tops don't allow the skin to breath and hold in body heat.  Not a god thing if you a warm bodied person or for women experiencing hot flushes of flashes.  I wore this shirt for the first time yesterday and it was comfortable.  I didn't get overheated or feel like the fabric was sticking to my skin.  However it is still cold here so I'll have to wait and see.  The top is plenty stretchy with jut 3% spanex.  Things I like about the top:Pros:The color:  The colors are vibrant and clear, not muted.The Cut:  The cut is tapered, not hanging like a tent like many of today's top.Less Spanx: This allows the top to be more relaxed and not fit like a second skin.The Cut: The scoop neck is not too revealing.The Cut: I like the length.  On me it's tunic length because I ordered the x-large.The Cut: Sleeve cut is nice.Cons:The Spanx:  Even though it's only 3% it could easily be less and have the same wearing experience.Fabric: It fits well but once the fabric settles it relaxes and become larger-that's because of the cotton which has a tendency to stretch out.The Fit: True to size?  What does that mean anymore?  There is a standardized size chart on most websites but there is no consistency in fit. I have ordered from Amazon clothes according to the size charts only to send them back because they didn't fit for one reason or another.  IMHO true to size means how do you want it to fit?  When I order more of this top I will order the large, but only because if I go smaller I'll lose the length I like.I would recommend this top.",
            "This fit great and form fitting.  I usually wear a large but ordered a extra large because of my DD cups.  The shirt stops right below the buttocks and I have a small waist with nice size hips.  I will definitely be ordering this shirt in other colors.",
            "I'm 5'11\" with very broad shoulders and a long torso. I recently had a baby and ordered an XL to fit my shoulders and be sightly loose over my midsection. I can also easily nurse in this shirt if that matters to anyone. This shirt is amazing! I've never loved a T-shirt this much. It's so soft and it's long, which is hard for me to find. I love this. I'm going to buy more for sure.",
            "I really like these blouses.  They are lightweight and nice looking.  The colors are very pretty too.  I like that the shirts are long, which is nice for people who want to detract attention from their mid-section.  I especially like the scoop neck.  I find that most T-shirts come up too high and if you are large-busted, they will just make you look fat.  The scoop neck on these pulls away from the neckline enough that it creates a really nice shape and hags well on the body.The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because the material is so light and delicate that I would recommend hand washing and hanging to dry rather than running them through a machine if you really want them to last.  On the other hand, the shirts are very inexpensive, so replacing them may not be an issue for you.  I definitely recommend.",
            "I'm very casual and have been replacing shirts with more simple tops as my older ones have worn out. I ordered 2 of these and loved the fit so much that I ordered more. The top is form-fitting but still flattering on me. The top goes down to the top of my thigh (I am 5'5, 178 lbs and an hourglass shape). I probably could have gone a size down to a Large, but wasn't sure if it would end up too tight across my D-cups.  The shirt is easy to dress up or down depending on the occasion. Have and would repurchase!",
            "The first one I ordered was red in xxl.  I usually get xxl in tees because I have natural 36DDs and don't always want to have guys staring, especially at work which is where I intend to wear these.  However, the xxl was very boxy.  Pretty color, but \u2b1b.  So I figured I'd go down a size even though the difference between the xl and xxl is bigger than the difference between any of the other sizes, a 9\" difference versus a 3\" difference.  Thankfully, the xl, this time in burgundy, fits ok, not too tight in the chest so I won't feel self-conscious at work.  The red is a very vibrant and bold shade, while the burgundy has depth and warmth.  The material is soft but has weight, not that thin tissue paper-like material, and in those colors is not see-thru.  The seams are even and trim.  The shirts do come out of the dryer a little wrinkled, but that may be because I dry my clothes on \"no heat\" so they last longer.  Hanging them on hangers helps get rid of some of the wrinkles but if you fold your tees, you'll likely have a very wrinkled shirt.I intend to get more in the burgundy (for work) and some of the other colors (just cuz), in xl.",
            "super comfy!  Nice &amp; long.  will purchase again &amp; think I need a L vs XL.  I am 5'1\" &amp; 140lbs",
            "These are a great fit. They don't cling in the underarm area and are not skin tight. I am 5'4\", 170 pounds (37ish inch waist, for reference), and I ordered the large. Not tight, and not super flow-y. I would say I am a large size in most tank tops/t-shirts, so definitely order the size that you would usually get unless you want it especially tight/loose. The colors are great and I saw no loose threads upon taking them out of the package.",
            "I like the fit but I felt scammed because it is definitely not made out of cotton. The label said 95% cotton 5% spandex but I know it\u2019s made out of rayon. Labeling and title are a lie these are not cotton. I will not purchase clothes from Chinese factories off Amazon again because I am tired of their products often being mislabeled on purpose to deceive customers."

I normally wear a large from Maurice\u2019s and places that are more women\u2019s sizing, and XL from places that are smaller and more junior sizing. Super comfy and seams well made. I was expecting the arm holes to be to big because normally they are on me but these were just right.",
            "I loved the top such much, I ordered 3 more in other colors. The fit is perfect , the weave is not see thru unless you go bra less, it shapes to your body line. It\u2019s cool enough to wear on a hot day. I\u2019m 162 lbs wear a 36B , I ordered an extra large since I hate wearing tight fitted tops. It fit me exactly how I like my tops. Love , love  them!!!!",
            "I love this shirt! The waffle knit fabric feels good quality, the buttons are nice and the medium fits great. I did notice there\u2019s a bit of a peek-a-boo between the buttons and fabric, I could see my bra. But if you wear a lighter cami underneath that would solve the problem! I am 5\u20196\u201d, 132lbs and a 36A for reference.",
            "Seriously these tops are amazing! I already had purchased this style in longer sleeved option from this brand and loved those ones too, but since I live in the hot Arizona desert I was very excited to see sleeveless options now! But then I made the mistake of buying from a different seller first as they had the same pictures, a pretty reputable brand on here... the other seller\u2019s shirt was awful! Returned it immediately and found the IWOLLENCE listing for this shirt and it\u2019s wonderful!!! It\u2019s a true waffle knit, and also one of the softest shirts I\u2019ve ever felt, but not in the \u201csoft because the fabric is too thin\u201d sort of way \u2014 this shirt\u2019s fabric is basically made of magic. It\u2019s the perfect weight, texture, looks exactly like they\u2019re photos. I swear I\u2019m not being paid and don\u2019t know anyone from this company lol cause I know I sound like an advertisement here! This shirt is just that good though!Also sizing is exactly right! I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d 145 pounds usually a medium in tops, that\u2019s what I ordered, the fit is PERFECT.PS When taking my photos in the beautiful blue/green top I only had my son\u2019s bathroom available for selfies so please excuse the mess behind me! Eek!",
            "Great material, well made, very comfortable.  I am 36D with a 27 waist so I ordered a M.  I would not go with a large and a small would have been too small across the bust.  I am 5\u20195\u201d and 137 lbs.  I bought the wine colored and will definitely purchase again in other colors.  The company even sent a cute silver necklace.  Happy with the product.",
            "I bought three different items for my friend. She absolutely love these shirt!! Way better then expected feels wonderful and nice quality! The button detail in the front adds to the style of the shirts. The tie in the front make sit very adjustable . She has gotten lots of compliments. This fits true to size. She is 126lbs 5\u20195\u201d and I got her a small one in white. See her photos. This fits great. They are real cute with skinny jeans and boots or sandals. I got another one for myself in different color.",
            "I am surprised how much I like this shirt. It is super comfortable and light so perfect for the summer. My only complaint is that there is a huge amount of space between the buttons which causes large gaps in the chest area when you sit down. Since I got the black one I think I may sew the shirt closed to prevent that from happening. Otherwise wearing a tank top underneath it would be a must.",
            "I ordered the rust red (which is more mauve- very pretty) and loved it so much I ordered another one in black. It\u2019s so cute and comfortable. True to size, I\u2019m 5\u20198 and 145lbs and a small fit perfectly. It still had a loose look but not super \u201coversized\u201d.",
            "These tops are great! Very lightweight and the waffle fabric is very breathable. I am 5'5\" 175lbs and I typically wear a size 10-12. I order this top in a Large, in both the green and red colors. The fit is exactly what I wanted, not too tight, drapes nicely. I am 9 months post partum and still have a bit of a tummy pouch going on, and the draping of this shirt nicely covers that area, and the knotted feature helps camouflage it as well. The buttons down the front are functional and I can easily nurse in this top.",
            "I\u2019m top heavy, big belly, 38D, bottoms size 14, prefer oversized XXL tops.  It\u2019s a roomy top (in a good way)  but not so big that you can see in the underarm holes.  I\u2019m the type who can\u2019t stand itchy material or tags in clothes so I find the waffle knit is  comfortable on my skin &amp; the material is soft and natural feeling. There are tails in front that you tie into a knot. The knot draws attention to my fat gut so that is not a flattering look for me, but that\u2019s not the shirt\u2019s fault. Ive actually left it untied &amp; the tails hanging down which looks better on me. I\u2019ve worn this shirt a lot since I got it &amp; I love it. It\u2019s held up in the laundry probably 10 times since I got it in early May. I wore it during a trip to Florida and it was perfect for the heat. Easy to dress it up or down."

It\u2019s more cropped in the front than I thought, but ties a little loser and I used a mid rise pant. Perfect! Thin material- but will be perfect for the concert in Vegas. Super cute!",
            "WOW! This top is so cute. Just what I wanted. The material is great- Love it. I ordered a Large and I'm about a size 14/16",

It fits perfectly tho, flowy and very light, I have thicker arms and top stays put off shoulders. Love how flattering it is, even slimming while hiding my tummy...and uhh muffin top issues. Ha.",
            "Beautiful but, size up 1 or 2. I normally wear a L/XL but ordered a 2x based off of experience from ordering clothes online they tend to run smaller.  The 2x is a little big but, i believe my regular size would be a bit snug.  I love this one!",

Thank you so much !!",

            "LOVE this tee. I am usually a M-L, with a little post-babies pooch, so I don't like clingy clothing. Ordered the olive in L, and it's PERFECT. I'm 5'9\"+, between 135-145lbs. The material is breathable, and the cotton/modal/spandex blend makes it feel slightly more polished than plain cotton, and I love the somewhat thicker weight... I've washed it in cool water, and while I was planning to air-dry it, a helpful kiddo put the laundry through the dryer, normal heat. The shirt did not shrink at all- YAY! I came back today to order three more of these, in different colors. For the price, comfort, and fit, you cannot beat this shirt.",
            "The fit and fabric of this shirt are wonderful - and the sizing is as expected. It's got a nice taper and the length is perfect for tucking into scrubs comfortably. The sleeves are tight, but not restrictive, so you don't have to worry about the opening of your sleeve dipping into any questionable substances. Overall, this long sleeve tee is worth every penny. I bought navy and white, and even the white is thick and doesn't have that sheer quality that some white tees have. Highly recommend this product.",
            "These are the best basic long sleeve tees I\u2019ve ever found!  They are a really nice light stretchy material, and they are actually long enough!  They aren\u2019t like most shirts that are way too short and tight.  I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d 112 lbs, and I got an XS.  It is a little bit loose, but that\u2019s how I like my shirts to fit.  I have an extremely long torso, and these shirts are a perfect length for me.  I don\u2019t even have to wear an undershirt.",
            "This shirt is so so so fantastic! The torso is long, the sleeves are long, and the material is perfect. I had read another review that talked about a small vs. extra small, and how it may run a little big. I went with the XS because of that review and it fits perfectly. Not tight but not too loose either. I can't believe it was only $11!!! I will be buying all the colors :-)",
            "I don't know why my images don't load right side up anymore. I am 5' 9\" 145lbs, 37, 31, 38 as I write this, and the medium fits well as usual. I am always on the hunt for the perfect long sleeve tee, and this isn't it, but it's great for $11.  I ordered more colors, but after wearing this one for the day I think I'll return them. I want to see if Woolworth's long sleeve tees are the ones I'm searching for. Patty Boutik has gloriously long sleeves, but her tops tend to be low cut with tight sleeves.Pros:THE SLEEVES ARE LONG ENOUGH.The burgundy is a lovely deep purple hue just like on the model.The torso is also long enough.Neckline is comfy, not too high, not too low: I don't have to worry about bending over to chase kids and revealing anything.Cons:The material isn't cottony enough. I felt my pits get moist when I was moving around a lot earlier.The sleeves could be looser at the bottom, but maybe they'll stretch a bit. They're also a little snugger over all than I prefer, but not awful.The shirt does sort of cling to my meager chest. It doesn't form to my body quite the way I like. Like cotton. sigh.It's a nice shirt, but it's not THE shirt.UPDATE:I changed my review to 2 stars after stocking up on Eddie Bauer, Carhartt, and Woolrich long sleeve tees. They're all more cottony and move with my body better. This shirt sort of got caught on my bustline and I ended up adjusting often throughout the day.",
            "Love the quality of this shirt.  Sleeves FINALLY long enough for me!  It runs big out of the box so I'm hoping it will shrink a bit.  And the shirt is really long. I may have to hem it.  But I'm very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fabric and workmanship. Amazon, keep adding basics items like this at these fantastic prices and you will be my new go to clothing store!!",
            "This shirt appears to have spandex in it, which I wouldn't have minded, if it is was so horribly small, for the size.I wear an XL, because I hate skin tight clothing.  This fit like a large.  If you buy it, order a size bigger.",
            "This tee is perfect for a fall/winter layering piece..  The weight is thick and it's very stretchy.  Color is beautiful. I ordered my regular size large and it fit perfectly bu the size chart is off.  My bust is 45.5 inches but the large chart shows a 38\" but, so go off your regular size and not the chart, unless you want the looser fit.  You won't be unhappy with these tees.",
            "This would make a great layering piece (I ordered three colors and kept one for that purpose) but returned to Amazon.  I really wanted this to be a stand alone piece but it is too form fitting for me and shows every imperfection I've got.  I also wanted something a little more substantial. As far as sizing goes, I ordered my normal size and it fit fine.",
            "If you have ever worn Lularoe leggings, then you know what kind of softness I\u2019m comparing this shirt to. It\u2019s buttery soft and with wonderful stretch. I love black and white strip cause it goes with everything from jeans to green army vests. I wore this shirt every week and even bought other colors. I bought an XL because I wanted the shirt to be loose on me. I just had a baby and didn\u2019t want to accentuate my love handles that take time to go away. I was 195lbs when u bought the shirt and my chest was a DDD. It fit great. Long enough to come midway down my bottom (leggings approved shirt). Most Importantly- it didn\u2019t shrink too much in the dryer like all my other thin shirts! That\u2019s the major headliner. Because all my clothes from China shrink the the dryer.Stripes look awesome with solid colored vests! I posted pics. It\u2019s just down right cozy, but you still look good enough to leave the house."

            "Such a cute top. The material is so soft too. I usually buy a large because im somewhat top heavy and end up having the shirt be way to big. I bought a medium in this and its perfect. Im 5'3 145lbs 36D if that helps anyone.",
            "I think the swing type halter tops are probably the most flattering design on any body type. I saw this blouse some time ago and hesitated to order it even though I knew this style is typically flattering. I was unsure of the material, because some people posted pictures that were not good quality and they look wrinkled and not very flattering material. However,that's not what this  blouse turned out to be.I went ahead and ordered it based on one of the young ladies who posted her picture, she's a young blonde girl she gave incredible photos. Which I believe are factual photos. It fit me and looked identical to hers. The material is superb and it's as good a quality as I buy at high end retail department store. For me, it fits pretty true to what I expected. I'm 5 '11 and wear almost entirely a USA small 4/6 occasionally, if it's cut really small I do purchase a medium if it's for a 6/8 med. I did since this is over the internet purchase order medium, because it's always better to be a little loose than too small. It fits perfectly for what I was looking for. It fits well and it's skims the body ..it does not cling! I highly recommend this blouse.. in fact I'm going to be ordering more from this particular seller.",
            "I was confused as there are 2 size charts for this. I went with the one in the photos, not the one in the link. Measure don't guess!!I am 5'7\", most shirts I wear are small or medium (manufacturer determines this). By chart a medium should fit, but was concerned about tight/clingy from comments. Ordered a large.Fits very well, not tight across chest (was biggest concern), very flattering, very flowy material. Looks stunning with the skirt I wanted to wear it with and will be a great addition to my wardrobe this summer as will pair with jean shorts exceptionally.",
            "This top is GORGEOUS! I love the color, kind of peacock blue/teal. I love the soft, drapey fabric. I love the gathered neckline. I would love this is more colors, but it appears they only have it in black and this color. I wear a 10-12 and the large fits perfectly. I do like the band at the hips, sometimes this is kind of \"oompa-loompa\" like and emphasizes an imperfect tummy, but this top is just really cute. I immediately ordered the black.",
            "After purchasing one black top (the halter with the twist at the neck), I bought another black and a dark blue. It's really flattering if you like a halter top.  The banded waist helps hide my less-than-perfect belly.  I wear it with a racer back bra, or without one at all. Good for casual or going out - and a long necklace looks great nestled in the fabric. I ordered the cream and apricot versions, too, but they were both see-through so I returned them.  Highly recommend this top in the darker colors.",
            "I don\u2019t know if I got a defect but it looks so weird. It is sewn on one side of the shirt but not the other.",
            "I am a size 12 or L. I ordered a M and it was pretty loose still. I use a clip or body tape to keep it secure. The tag in the top says M but the tag attached to it says XL. I ended up returning the first one because of this then I realized the second one they sent me said xl as well but on the top itself is labeled M.The color is beautiful, a true vibrant pink. The material is soft and is of good quality, not thin or see through at all. I definitely recommend it, just be aware of sizing. I\u2019m 165lbs and usually wear a M or L in tops. If I order another one I will definitely do a small",
            "Sending this back. It is way too big on me. I would need an xs, as the chest band is very loose. I\u2019m a 32D bra, so I\u2019m not tiny chested, either. I\u2019m only 108, so maybe someone a little thicker would do just fine w a small. I tried putting on a padded strapless bra under it and that didn\u2019t even help. Too short, compared to another brand I was able to get in an extra small.",
            "Love the color and the style. Not too tight. Great stretch material.",
            "What a cute style and it is very form fitting. Unfortunately, very difficult to button/unbutton since the \"eyelets\" are these very tight elastics.  I wound up having to tear one off to take the blouse off as the neck area is to small to take off.  Hooks would be a better option. The main downfall of this shirt...the stylized portion of the collar is inserted into the seams through two small holes...which are not sewn or reinforced.  They became more prominent by the second wear.  They literally look like the shirt is ripped."

I can wear it, but I really should have ordered a large as I wear it for Pickleball and it is a little tighter than I like.  I also have one in a large which I love.  It is not too big.

I've worn this shirt every time I've gone to the pool and I've been very happy with it. Would buy again.",

They also dont ride up all the time like other tank tops and I layer everything. And riding up all day is such a pain. So thats huge for me. And when your plus size you never know how things are going to fit on line, but these are perfect.",

I just ordered three more in a larger size.What I like about it...It's fairly long and thin, so I can tuck it into my jeans or shorts and IT STAYS PUT without showing a tank line on my behind.It's tight enough that I can forgo my bra and my little girls get some support. I like the way my breasts look in this camisole and that's saying something. I wear mine solely under tanks, t-shirts and blouses.The fabric is a thin cotton blend and it's rather soft and stretchy. It's thin, but it's not too thin. There's no itchy tag and I'm grateful for that.The spaghetti straps are well constructed; I just love spaghetti straps.These camis are super affordable and my goodness... there are plenty of colors to choose from.

The length is longer than a normal top. It is more like a tunic length. Perfect for over leggings. I absolutely love the length aspect. The straps are adjustable too, which is awesome. I am definitely buying more. This shirt is perfect!",

That was definitely not the case for me. I could have comfortably wore an XL and I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d, 40E and 190lbs.It\u2019s a very cute and good quality top. Somebody complained about pocket placement, but everything was good for me. I really like the shirt. I don\u2019t plan to return it, even though it\u2019s large. I can wear it knotted. I\u2019ll probably buy again in a XL this time.I would recommend this top. (:",

            "This top is extremely comfortable.  So much so, you can forget you're wearing it!I wore it travelling to the TCI and it looked fresh and felt fluid and soft at my destination.  It's not the dressiest of tops but for casual wear, it's a good buy, and a jacket dresses it up sufficientlyThis washes easily and DRIES QUICKLY.  I used it as a pajama top in a pinch and it made a cool sleep top, too.I plan on buying more in various colours.The top falls at hip length, making it flattering and versatile for many body types.  It runs a tad large perhaps but not overly so.The colour-blocked pocket detail makes this top stand out from dozens of other nondescript tops in one shade only.Similar tops LOOK lightweight but are surprisingly heavy to pack but this casual shirt is light and rolls up neatly in a suitcase or carry-on.Good buy, this.  Love it.Thank you for taking the time to read this review.  I hope it's been of help to you.",

I can usually wear a size S or M, but I chose the M based on other reviews and because I wanted a looser fit.  The fabric is so soft and comfortable.  It washes well and doesn't wrinkle.  I dried the shirt on low heat after the first wash and high heat after the second (because I forgot), and it didn't shrink at all.  The shirt is perfect to wear with jeans for a casual look or to dress up with black pants.  The v of the neckline doesn't dip too low to show cleavage, and the white fabric isn't see-through, so there's no need for a cami underneath.  I highly recommend this shirt.  I would definitely buy this brand clothing from this seller again.",

However when it does get scratches it seems to scratch quite deeply. The edges also have picked up a dirty looking blue from living in my back pocket, and the rubbery material makes it impossible to clean (if anyone has tips I'd love to hear them!). The phone is also more exposed due to the curved edges, so the 2 or 3 times I've dropped my phone the phone edge has caught and cracked my glass screen protector (previous phone and otterbox was for the S7 with a full edge wrap/ more protection)",

            "First, let me say that these are the softest camisoles I've ever owned. You cannot beat the price for a three pack of these tanks. They are of good quality material and they are incredibly comfortable. As for the 4 stars, they are a bit big on me, but not so much that I would return them. I don't like it when camisoles are too tight. I'm 5'6\", 160 lbs, 29.5\" waist with an athletic build. I purchased the size large based on the size chart and on the other reviews. If I order more, which I'm considering, I would order the medium size. I'll update this review if I do.  These are great for layering clothing. The package arrived on time as well. Hope this review helps with your decision. Happy Shopping!",
            "First off let me say these tanks are very soft and very well made. I ordered a size small after reading some reviews. When the package arrived last Friday I tried on the black tank. It was a little tight so I returned them and re-purchased them in the size medium, I received the 2nd package Monday and tried the black tank on Tuesday. The medium is just as tight IF not tighter than the small size?? I'm not sure how to advise others of buying these tanks. I am trying one more time, hoping the 3rd times the charm on this order. For reference I am 5\u20323'' and 135. I will update my review after trying on the large size.",
            "Incredibly soft and comfortable tank tops.  Great for layering.  Fit true to size for me. I'm 5'9\" 135 lbs and ordered size small.  These are the perfect length for me, not too long and not too short. Material is of medium thickness, in the picture added to the review I'm wearing a white bra underneath and it's not noticeable unless up close.",
            "These camisoles are wonderrful! I rarely write a review of a product but I have found it hard to find the right camisole.  They are either too long or too tight.  I wear a camisole everyday and need something comfortable.  They are light and silky smooth and fit perfectly.  NOT too long or too tight.  Like a light, silky second skin.  And nice enough to wear by themselves.  I immediately bought 3 more",
            "Im 5'2 and 155 lbs. After reading previous reviews I ordered 2 sizes up. I normally wear m-l and ordered xl. The fit is comfortable and just right. I purchased these to wear under my work shirts as I live in Florida and need the layer so my work shirt doesnt have giant sweat spots. The softness feels great on my skin. I just received today and I have only tried the tank top on, but plan on wearing to work today, so we will see how it holds up throughout a hot humid day.",
            "Hands down the most comfortable tank tops I've worn. These are so soft and lightweight that it almost feels like I'm not wearing anything. Contrary to some reviewers' experience, I found these to run large and not transparent. I would be comfortable with wearing even the white and gray ones by themselves rather than layering pieces.The tops seem well-made, not cheap material. They don't cling to the body or my pants. But they are a bit too big on me. I'm 5'3, 115 lbs, normally XS/S. There's a gap between the chest (near the armpit) and the top, which I got in size small.",
            "I bought these tanks because I have a large chest and always wear a tank under my shirts. They cover well, are very comfy and stretchy, and fit me just as expected. I am 5\u20193 and 180 lbs and bought an extra large.If I had one critique, I would say that the fabric is a bit thin and I would never wear one without a shirt or cardigan over it.",
            "These really are pretty decent tank tops for the price.  They are super stretchy and pretty comfortable.  However...they are VERY thin...I mean PAPER THIN.  If you don't mind that, then this may be a great tank for you.  Sizing is what is expected.  The length on me (I'm 5' 8\") was to my hip bones.  This is not a long tank.",
            "This tank tops are exactly as described. I love the material so much, supersoft and lightweight. After being washed several times it is still like new. I wear it under shirts and as a sleepwear. It never dissapointed me. It is stretchy and I would recommend sizing down.",
            "They came on time and packing was good.  Some people said they are really thin and wrinkles bad, but I bought them to wear under my outers, so they are fine.  It was really had for me to find tank tops which is not too long, not too short, not too tight, not too lose, not too low around neck, not too high around neck, not too thick, and not get shrank when I wash and dry.  So, I'm pretty happy with this product, and thinking about re-order different color ones too."

            "I was a little nervous ordering this top, due to the mixed reviews.I don't like my tops clingy to me; I prefer the flowy feel! I have a 38-40-D chest, which sometimes leaves this difficult. If I do find a top I love, it typically makes me feel extremely unproportionate. This top does NONE of that!!! I typically wear between a Large - XL top, and I ordered the XXL in this top and it fits beautifully!!! I'm comfortable, confident and not worried about my belly sticking out or it being too tight around my chest!!! I plan on buying more colors of this exact same top! I also love the cut of the sleeve, kind of a sexy look for women!!!!",
            "Love the color, love the style, love the fit. It\u2019s not long like the photo, it\u2019s more of a slouchy look. But I love everything about this and will most likely order more! I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d, size D cup and 130 pounds and I ordered a small",
            "Pleasantly surprised with how quickly this arrived, well-packaged, and superior quality. The material, workmanship, and style are wonderful. In a store I would pay twice the cost for this quality. The material is soft, not too thin, stretchy and comfy looking. Beautiful true Navy Blue. Bought the tank as pictured and will consider more colors based on this one",
            "The top looks a little more casual than the picture but overall totally love. Good material and the color was what I was expecting [ordered a blue one.] Arm holes are perfect size, comfortable but not a giant gaping hole that shows everything. Super comfortable. Actually came back to look for more and decided to review while I was at it.",
            "The color is as pictured and very nice.  I love the fit and the tuck at the bottom gives it extra character.  The tank is loose enough to cover my \"chunk\" but also fitted enough to give me a long and lean look.  Paired it with some white shorts and a long necklace like the picture.  Super cute!",

It definitely doesn't hug your belly (if you have one), and the hike in the thigh area is very cute. If you are like me and have a bit of an overhang in the stomach, don't worry, the shirt is long enough to cover it. You can buy this one confidently.",

            "Note about pictures:  these are how they look after several months of wear.  I've included the Kadee next to the citilane so you can see the difference between unisex and standard sizing.I bought a pair of these in size 7 in black at the same as the size 7w citilane unisex crocs in red.  Very disparate ideas of what a size 7 is between both sandals.The citilane were very wide and chucky, and the straps ended up giving me a flew blisters.  These are vary narrow and a little undersized but are otherwise more comfortable to me and zero blisters.  These also feel a little less supportive and cushioned than the citilane, but I still find them more comfortable.I've worn them for months, and on several multi mile walks, and they've been nothing but comfortable.I figured I'd reorder in size 8 for my next pair (the lemon ones) because my heel sat a bit too close to the back on the 7.  Well, heel sits just as close on the 8 so the only difference is more length where the toes are and more width.I'm generally a size 7 to 7 and a half.  My foot is 10 inches in length from my big toe to my heel, and the widest part of my foot measures 9 inches around.",
            "Warning- DO NOT leave these in the sun for any length of time. When these arrived, I loved them! They fit perfect, were lightweight, and were comfortable on my feet. I took them on a beach trip the first week I had them and they did great walking in the sand and were easy to clean. The issue came when I rinsed them off and left them on the deck to dry...they shrunk. When I say say shrunk, I mean they went from a perfect size 9 to a size 6!! They were in the sun for less than 2 hours when I tried to put them on and realized that my heel was hanging off the back. I compared them with another pair I bought in a different color and could not believe how small they had become! I would give them 5 stars if it were not for the incredible shrinkage.",
            "I really wanted a pair of summer sandals that I could wear all day without dying of foot and leg pain at the end of the day and I know from experience the foot bed of the croc shoe is very comfy.  I also didn't want to break the bank. Problem is, I normally wear a size 8 but every size 8 croc's I've ever tried are too long for my feet, leaving more than a full inch of space from end of toe to tip of shoe. This causes me to trip over my own toes or 'drag' the toe every so often, so I no longer buy size 8 croc's. I also need a wide shoe and must beware of  multiple straps because they can pinch and bind in all the wrong places.  I decided on the tried and true flip flop, as they can usually accommodate wide feet due to the basic \"openness\" of the shoe. I took a chance and ordered down to a size 7 and glad I did because size 8 would have been way to long. I do wish the flops offered a little more arch support as I have high arches, but all in all, they are working out well. The back of my heel sits right at the heel cup and there is still room at the toe as you can see in the pics. I love the squishy bouncy feel of the shoe when walking or standing. I broke one of my toes before these arrived and will be wearing them daily until my toe heals.  FYI, I deducted one star for lack of half sizes and one star for mediocre arch support.",
            "I decided to go one size up and they fit perfect! I normally order size 8 in sandals that have no half sizes but after reading reviews, I decided to go with a 9. I wear 8.5 in closed toe shoes and 8 in sandals. So go with a 9 if you normally wear an 8 or an 8.5. These shoes are a whole size off. I owned and loved my Kadee originals but my puppy chewed them up last week and I thought I could get another pair and they were no longer available. The Kadee 2's are just as comfortable on day one. The Kadee originals, I had to wear for a couple weeks and got a blister and then they fit well. These are good right out of the box. They are not as arch supportive as the originals but they will do. These feel a bit thinner.  Although, I am still looking for another pair to wear around the house on tile floors. These do have a bit of arch support but for flat floors, I feel I need a bit more. The price on these is a winner. I would buy them again, good shopping shoe but not all day support. If you have lower back problems like I do from gluten allergies and looking for all day wear on cement floors get another style. Good garden shoe, easy rinse and go.",
            "My daughter needed shower shoes for college dorm use,  and these are  perfect for that: all rubber so they dry quickly, grippy bottom and inside, wide enough. But as for wearing them as regular flip-flops: probably not. They are very thin and flexible---if you walk too fast, the front edge can catch on the ground and bend completely under your foot, tripping you---and the raised-dot pattern on the soles is uncomfortable to walk or stand in for long periods of time.She normally wears a size 10, but ordered 11 in these so they'd be loose enough for easy showering. Good thing, because even with the full size up, her heel is right at the back!",
            "I purchased these flip flops specifically for beach/pool wear. I was storing them in my car to have handy. On a day trip to the beach I reached for them to find that they had shrunk up to the size of something that would fit a toddler. Very disappointed. Beware.",
            "While I LOVE these sandals and the colors they come in, I had to return the first two pairs on Amazon because they were too small in my size. Bought my third in one size up from Crocs and one more from Amazon. That worked, but I noticed something strange. The pair from Crocs site and the one from Amazon are different. Amazon pair is loose from the toe and where the strap sits and the one from Crocs in snug. The width is visibly different, too. I bought it here for the color. Not sure if these are original. I'm keeping them, though.",
            "Soooo disappointed. Bought these 3 yrs ago, been wearing them since then...right out of the box. Great flip flop. The thong part popped on the right one. So I ordered the same pair, same size. Hit \"order again\". What I received was shorter, tighter, and feels hard. I put the old one next to the new one. The new one is not the same. The design inside of the flip flop is different. There is no crocodile in the heel bed. No wiggle room. I have wide feet and these are not comfortable. I'll try gorilla glue on the old ones. Btw, I ordered the size 11 for \"end of work day comfort\", and literally hit \"order again\". So disappointing...smh.",
            "I recently wound up with a foot injury, needing more arch support and cushion in my shoes. I love wearing flip flops in the summer, whether to the beach, to muck around in the garden, or just kicking around town. Unfortunately, my old flip flops just killed my feet- I would have horrible pain even after taking out the garbage. I ordered these Crocs flip flops hoping they would be a better option, and they certainly are! The are very lightweight, surprisingly supportive for a flip flop, and a little bit cushy. As long as I am not walking or on my feet all day, they are comfortable for hours! My only minor disappointment was the color. I ordered bronze, thinking they would be the same dark gold, slightly sparkly color of the Crocs Mary Janes I had a few years back, but they are just a dark tan color. I do love that they are easy to clean through!",
            "I ordered theses in size 8W/6M for myself who is somewhere between 7.5 and 8 in laides shoes.  These shoes are way too small.  Since they fit my moer who wear a size 6.5.  Asidefrom being to small, the quality is nothing impressive.  Not horrible but nothing near the quality the old Crocs were.  The Crocs I bought 7 years ago are soft, thick, durable and true to size.  My last couple puchases with Crocs were nothing but disappointing."

I wear a 12 or M to L top, I ordered the Large and it fits like a glove with plenty of room.  Hangs below the waist and hip area.

The only thing I really dont care for is the material. I feel like the print looks kind of cheap. The material kind of reminds me of that 70's pant suit material my mom used to wear, almost like polyester. I've worn it a couple times and will continue to wear it, it's just not my favorite. UPDATE!! After  submitting my review, the seller offered me a full refund or another shirt. I picked another shirt  and kept the one that I had previously bought and I couldn't be happier. Outstanding customer service!!!",
            "I originally loved this shirt so much that I also bought one in white! The fitting of it was perfect and flattering, the material was nice and I loved the print. But after 2 washes, the black background color faded, a lot. The white one lasted a lot longer and that one I gave 5 stars. Overall I loved the shirt but I would just be mindful of the black or darker colors as they may fade quickly."

            "I love ordering clothes on Amazon, especially because having Prime makes it so easy to try on and return any clothes I don\u2019t absolutely LOVE. As a single mom of a young son with multiple special needs, I haven\u2019t had time to go shopping for myself since before he was born 4 years ago! Lately almost everything I\u2019ve been getting from here has been a dud. So trying on this shirt was an extremely exciting surprise! It is PERFECT! In short, it looks and fits exactly like their picture depicts and is super soft, too!I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d / 145 pounds / 36B bust and usually would wear a Medium in typical American young women\u2019s shirts, so in order to make sure I got the fitted but loose look shown in their pictures, I went up a size and ordered it in Large and it worked out perfectly for me! So I\u2019d recommend that anyone who can go up one size do so, at least if you want the fit to be the same as they show. I should note though that I suspect from the way this fits that my regular medium would\u2019ve been okay too but just not as perfect as going one size up.Oh and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re wondering if the material really is heathered like shown in the pictures - maybe I\u2019m the only one who cares about this but if anyone else out there does too than \u2014 YES, the shirt is heathered just like shown! I just can\u2019t recommend this top enough! Great for a workout shirt, or a cute casual outfit, or just for lounging. I seriously think I\u2019m going to get another in a different color which I never do! Just size up one size if available and enjoy!! \ud83d\ude00Ps Attaching pictures but they don\u2019t do the shirt justice, the sellers pictures actually do a better job showing what it really looks like! Also adding a close up on the material to show the heathering etc, note that this close up pic is of the BACK of the top. Hope this helps someone!EDIT - Purchased a second top, same size and in purple and it\u2019s just as wonderful as the first! Attaching photos of it too! And just to be clear, when looking at picture of back of purple shirt, yes that\u2019s the tag I hadn\u2019t taken off yet as I was so excited to try it on \u2014 I can\u2019t think of the last top I loved enough to buy more than one of. These are so good!",
            "It's very hard to find cotton shirts these days and this is a wonderful, light to medium weight, not see through sleeveless shirt. I followed the size guide from the manufacturer and it fits perfect! I'm 5'6\", 125 lbs, 36C and ordered a Large for your comparison. This is a juniors top.I didn't realize that there is also a small diagonal line sewn across the from of the shirt for a little more detail. Very subtle. The stitching is done very well with no extra threads or loose stitching. Excellent quality! This shirt is very comfortable, lays very nicely, just the right length, hitting exactly as it does on the model. It doesn't flare out at the hips nor is it skin tight. It helps hide the small tummy bulge I've been gifted after menopause. I have a long tattoo going down the middle of my back and this shirt shows it off nicely. I purchased the wine color and I will be purchasing 2 more, one in blue and one in green.Very please with my purchase and I highly recommend this excellent cotton sleeveless shirt.",
            "This is a simple shirt, but fits nicely. It is a T-shirt type material and also has an open triangle in the back. Very cute with jeans. I bought a medium which is what I typically buy and it fits as expected. Slightly stretchy, which is good since I have a slightly larger bust.",
            "This is beautiful and professional. Not see through, good quality, and my bra doesn't show in the back. I will be ordering more colors.",
            "Based on the measurements, I ordered an XXL (I usually wear M or L, depending on the brand) - turned out to be a perfect shirt! The fabric is soft and quite substantial, not clingy at all. It keeps its shape after the dryer. The cut is modest but interesting. Overall a great shirt - ordering more in other colors!",
            "I\u2019ll get another. I\u2019m hefty on the breast area. I have enough room.",
            "Great top, based on the size chart though I thought it would run small, so I ordered up. Normally I'm a size M-L depending on the brand but I ordered an XL fearing it would either be too tight or short for my tall torso (I'm 5'9'', measurements 37-30-40 and weigh 140 lbs). The XL doesn't look bad and can be worn with a looser fit, but since I wanted it to look a bit more fitted I'm thinking the L or even a M might've been fine for the width. Not sure about the length though. It's fine now but when I order smaller sizes I always run the risk of having a nice fitting top that's too short for me.",
            "I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d, and 4/6.  Medium Fit was looser than I wanted. So sexy though.",
            "I am 5\u20195\u201d and 125lb. Based on reviews, I ordered a medium (I don\u2019t like my clothes tight) and found it to be a little too big/boxy. A small may fit me better so I may try that in the future. However, the material was very soft and seemed to be good quality which is why I gave this 4 stars. I would recommend ordering your normal size instead of sizing up.",
            "We ordered these shirts to be screen printed with our logo as our company uniform top for the summer.  We love how these fit and wear. We will order more."

The phone is also more exposed due to the curved edges, so the 2 or 3 times I've dropped my phone the phone edge has caught and cracked my glass screen protector (previous phone and otterbox was for the S7 with a full edge wrap/ more protection)",

            "So far I've ordered 5 of these shirts. I've worn and washed all 5 and feel comfortable leaving a realistic review for those of you unsure about purchasing. I ordered a 4X and the shirts fit me more like a regular tshirt than an oversized long tshirt but I am also 370lbs and top heavy. The shirts did not shrink much and I dried them on regular heat. The black did noticeably fade with one way but the others did not. From my experience I recommend washing on cold and hang drying. For the price, fit and comfort I will order these shirts regularly!!!",

Out of the 5 shirts I got, this one is my favorite.",

            "Was excited to see the other reviews for this top that it actually fit true to size. I am 5\u20196\u201d and wear a 22/24 (24 jeans at Lane Bryant). I ordered the 3X based on the other reviews saying it ran true to size or a little big. I wanted a shirt that covered my butt and not cling. I\u2019m not big into leggings but have a few pair I like I wear with boots during the fall and winter. This shirt will work great for that as long as it doesn\u2019t shrink when it\u2019s washed. The material is soft but not too thin or see-through.The biggest problem I have with short sleeve shirts from anywhere is with my arms. They are either too tight or too short and roll up. These sleeves are a great length and very comfy. And nice for Layering over a long sleeve.  Also, the neck line is cut low but I like it that.I plan on ordering some more colors soon. The red was the perfect color and as shown.Will update the review if it changes after washing",

With regards to cleavage is perfect is neither too revealing or too high, very classy. Item as easy to wash and dry, does not wrinkle, loose shape or shrinks (tumble dry low).

It's too long for me to wear untucked but tucking it in to high-waisted pants or a pencil skirt is perfect for work. And it's not a stretchy fabric exactly but I never felt constricted like I do in other shirts. It's also not see-through so I can just wear a bra underneath and not cause a stir at the office. Great professional look, great with some cute black or green jeans for after-hours, the possibilities are there. I really want to buy more but I'm just not a fan of the other colors.",

            "Love this shirt!!! The colors labeled \u201cvarietied\u201d truly do have the heathered appearance as appears in photos, yay! These runs a bit large but again just like depicted in their photos. I\u2019m a med or large in shirts (5\u20197\u201d / 150 lbs / 36B chest) and got the medium and it fits just like the seller\u2019s photo shows, nice and loose but not too baggy. I wanted to wear with shorts since I live in the hot AZ desert but didn\u2019t realize this was closer to tunic length and when worn as is it definitely looks better of leggings/jeggings, so I just tucked the front into my shorts a bit and voila, perfect! I recommend this shirt for sure, if you want the slightly looser fit shown on model than go for your regular size and if you\u2019re between sizes I recommend picking your smaller size. If you want a more fitted look and/or aren\u2019t wanting the tunic length you could try going down a size smaller than you usually wear as this medium I\u2019m wearing is still roomy enough all around that I\u2019m quite certain a small would\u2019ve fit great for pairing with shorts. But I definitely don\u2019t think anyone should size up, even if you\u2019ve got a larger bust this offers plenty of room in the chest area, and I have rather big shoulders but again plenty of room there. Overall I think this is a beautiful and very versatile tank that is made for wearing with leggings/jeggings but can be tucked in to easily pair with denim shorts or skirts too! The fit should flatter most body types easily and stick to your true size, go with the smaller size if you can\u2019t pick between two sizes, and avoid sizing up as I can\u2019t imagine anyone needing to with this lovely loose and long length top.

Getting a weird feeling that there's a good chance it was made in a sweatshop somewhere in Asia, I sent it back.",

I usually wear xxl and this fits as expected. Length is also good.  Long enough in back to wear with leggings or tighter pants. Shorter length in front keeps the shirt from looking like a maternity shirt. I liked this shirt enough to purchase another color.",

I  have not washed it yet and it seems that 30 degrees is too warm for a wash, I guess cold wash is best. I am an avid warm wash user. Hang dry only. Soo....some seems to be seen as to whether or not this is a great item. But as I stated, the price allowed me to test the waters. I ordered three, if all fails they can be sleep tops. I like the patterns and the style mucho.  If they pan out I will buy more. Cheers."

Not a snug fitting junior style, but shorter sleeves and some curve to it, it's a nice fitting t-shirt without out it looking manly! Soft, nicely fitting t-shirts.

No major shrinkage in the wash, no fading or bleeding since they've been tie-dyed.  They are great.These shirts arrived as expected.My favorite quality is that these shirts REALLY ARE BREATHABLE.  They do wear cooler than most cotton t-shirt.  I put it on not expecting a large difference, but it's there.

These tee shirts are not as pictured. In the photo of the white tee it looks like it is made of a thicker fabric than ordinary tee shirts, and this is why I purchased them. However, these shirts are as thin as any other cheap tee shirt that you might find out there, which I know because I have purchased several kinds of those shirts while trying to find something thicker. The white shirt is transparent to the point of being inappropriate when worn alone and would need to be worn as a layer. That said, there are several redeeming qualities for this shirt. The first is that they make an excellent undershirt and are very thin and breathable for that purpose. The second is that they are cut as a woman's tee shirt rather than a man's and this makes a big difference. Overall, I would say that this is an okay tee shirt, but probably not worth the money if you are buying them in bulk.",
            "I tye dyed this t for a friend. 100% cotton.  looks great!",
            "I returned the t-shirt. I am 5'4\", 135 pounds, normally wear a size 10 or medium, but this t-shirt was very snug around my hips.  I asked my husband, \"Have I become a \"large\" woman??\"  He laughed and assured me not.  I'm 65 years old and not into body-hugging clothes, and this Tee was just not gonna make it for me.",
            "The fabric is nicer than I expected, but the cut is strange.  It binds around the neckline and shoulders.  It's cut too narrow through the body and hips.  I'll save it to wear in emergencies but I won't order another one.  I'd love to find a nice, decent tee shirt like we used to get in years past.",
            "Got it for my girlfriend to make a custom shirt and was a bit small but good for the price",
            "I bought 9 of these in different colors from three different sellers.  They were all consistent in sizing--pretty small for a small.  I usually buy extra smalls, and these are not roomy on me.  The sleeves are a bit longer than they appear on the pictured model.  The fabric is too light-weight for my preference, and (even after two initial washings) the shirts are scratchy.  Not the quality I expected.  In the past, I have found Hanes to be reliable if not fashionable.  I bought these to wear around the house with tights.  Unfortunately, they may go into the rag bin.  They are just not comfortable enough.  For reference, I am 5'3\" and 107 lbs.",
            "I ordered this T-Shirt in 2X wanting and expecting it to be big and roomy. Not so!!  I always buy larger shirts for gardening, etc., and I have other T-shirts that are size 1X that are FAR larger than this T-shirt.I ordered the black T-shirt and the printed info on the shirt states that it is 100% cotton, not the 90/10 listed at the top of this page.  It is 100% cotton as stated lower in the description.  The one plus is that the fabric is super soft!But I am disappointed in the sizing. \ud83d\ude15  A 2X fits more like an extra-large, but the sleeves are also VERY short.  Although this is preshrunk, I still fear this will shrink in the wash so if I keep it, I will wash it in cold water and air dry.  It's almost like they made the shirts THEN shrunk them! \ud83d\ude10Bottom line -- order 1-2 sizes larger than you normally wear unless you are looking for a form-fitting T-shirt with cap sleeves. \ud83d\ude09",
            "The material is a bit thinner than I prefer but not terrible and the fit tighter than I prefer, but I really wanted a pale pink T-shirt for working out that wasn't too expensive,so settled for this. These do shrink when washed and the side seams came out twisted after washing. And they come out of the dryer wrinkled, unlike the Fruit of the Loom brand I would buy if they had this style and color.Bought the looser fitting version in a larger size. Like it a bit better. Would not buy this again, though I read that shirts vary depending upon where they were made??"

            "I don't want to paint the product unfairly, so I need to be clear: it did fit a little big, but that's just because I ordered a size too large, thinking it would run small. It doesn't - it runs true to size. I am 5`10, normally a size 18W no more no less. I ordered a 3X, I think (if I remember correctly), so I should have just gotten the 2X. I personally didn't care for the style and cut for my current body shape and size. I am largely built, but more or less proportional with a large chest, so I prefer a-line tops that hug the chest and have a gentle taper down to the waist. It wasn't as fitted as I'd like to be, but if I lost weight I might like the style better. Other than that, the top was beautifully made - looks more expensive than it is, soft fabric, rich full color and had a nice swing to it. Fair warning, if you are plus-sized and top heavy, it might make you look a little boxy. I do recommend both the brand and the seller. Great top overall!",
            "Pleasantly surprised at how cute, comfy and wearable this nice top is. It should probably be washed first due to the fabric \u201cnew\u201d smell and factory creases but other than that, it\u2019s adorable and again very comfortable and I highly recommend it. I bought a xxL because I\u2019m a bigger girl, but I can picture it on a thin person \ud83d\ude03.Extra fast shipping too! Very pleased.",
            "I\u2019m always weary of ordering tops online but this top fit great. The material is soft and the fit is perfect. I\u2019m 5 feet and 145 pounds and ordered a large. I love the blue color too.",
            "Love it so so so much",
            "Size was true to description. I'm 5'5\" and 155  lbs and usually wear a L because I don't like anything tight. The shirt was perfect size and very soft. It's a great price too so I'm going to order a few more in different colors. BTW, the mint green shirt I ordered is just that, mint green!",
            "My 1st cold shoulder top. Wasn't sure what size so I usually size up but based on reviews I didn't. Glad I ordered regular size XL bcuz it fits perfectly! I'm 5'3 170lbs. The only negative is upon unpacking, it has a bad chemical smell. I popped it in the dryer on gentle with Downy dryer sheet &amp; it's fine now.",
            "Very pretty.  It came all wrinkled, so I threw it in the wash, and then accidently put it in the dryer.  It sat there a few days.  When I pulled it out, it was all wrinkly again, so I just hung it on a hanger and forgot about it for a few more days.  The wrinkles all just fell out and the shirt did not shrink!  Anyway, I received many compliments when I  finely wore it.  I recommended this shirt.",

            "I ordered a larger size per other peoples comments but it was a tad too big.  I liked the top so I kept it and ordered another one in a smaller size.  The top is really cute and soft material.  It does not cling to your body at all and thats why I like it.  I have some rolls that I like to hide and this top does not give them away."

            "I got the gray one because I wanted the cut out shoulder detail. I think it adds a little edge to an otherwise casual top. I love the length, which makes it perfect for leggings or skinny jeans. It\u2019s also quite comfortable and soft.",
            "Looks like it\u2019s photo with soft material that is not see through and secure stitching. I like that it is plenty long enough to cover my butt while wearing leggings while the front camouflages my tummy (the back doesn\u2019t do much for my butt but I don\u2019t blame the shirt for that). I wanted it to be on the loose side and ordered the XXL (I\u2019m 5\u20194 and 240lbs).",
            "Fabric is soft, color is lovely (blue). I'm 5'4, 210-ish lbs, size 16/18 jeans and the XL top fit as I hoped it would. It's a beautiful top and decently priced at around $17. If they were just a bit cheaper in price, I'd probably stock up on these. For their current price, I may buy one more color.",
            "Absolutely LOVE this shirt!! I am 19 weeks pregnant, belly measuring 39inches, I am 5'6\" and 155 pounds..I bought a medium. I have room to grow in it since it's a loose fitting style, but I think I may order a large as well for the end of my pregnancy. The top is so cute and comfortable!! Definitely would recommend this item. It's awesome that I can wear it during my pregnancy and continue to wear it afterwards too without looking like I'm wearing a maturity top.",
            "The top portion of this shirt is everything. As a girl that still wears black in AZ Summer months it kept me relatively cool and cute. I\u2019m 5\u20192 200lbs and I ordered a 2x. I could easily pull this off as a short dress and the shirt runs a little loose around the middle which I appreciated. Covers the booty and camel toe so I\u2019ll definitely be reaching for this again and purchasing in another color when I want a cute, loose and relaxed look.",
            "I ordered the grey top with the little shoulder strap. First off this is a really comfortable shirt. This shirt does fit true to size so no need to order a larger size. I ordered a 2x which is 2-3 sizes too big but I made it work woth a cute long necklace and some leggings.I plan to order more shirts in my correct size \ud83d\ude03 Super comfy and worth it",
            "I\u2019ve gotten this shirt from another company and wanted it oversized and it was just that. This one is not. If feels more like 3 sizes smaller. Not happy.",
            "I am giving this a 4 stars because it is WAY to long. In the image I pulled it back so it wouldn\u2019t be so long. The material is nice and it\u2019s cute but way to long. I am 5\u201d6 and have a normal torso and this hits to my mid thigh. The color is great and overall great. Just to long",
            "This shirt looks absolutely adorable on! It is so comfortable to throw on with a pair of jeans or some shorts. It fits as expected and looks so flattering on. I love the knot in the front and the one shoulder strap. Its also easy to throw in the washer and dryer. I\u2019m thrilled with this cute shirt!",
            "I\u2019m usually a little bit hesitant when it comes to floral patterns. They\u2019re harder to judge online than solid colors. However, this shirt is so adorable and I\u2019m so glad I took a leap of faith to \u201cadd to cart\u201d. Here\u2019s why:- Fabric: beautiful patterns- it\u2019s not too vibrant or dull. It\u2019s perfect for summer, spring, and fall because of the breathable fabric materials.- Fit: true to size. I\u2019m usually a small and this shirt fits perfectly. I can see it fitting a good range of body type, big or smal busts.- Style: very cute. I love cold shoulders but sometimes they\u2019re a little too much. This shirt offers one sided cold shoulder which makes it so stylish and adorable at the same time.Long story short - buy it! You won\u2019t regret it."

            "I am obsessed with these tees! They are literally the only tee in my wardrobe. I now own 16 white, one black, one tan and one grey.As a minimalist of sorts, I\u2019ve resolved to no longer investing lots of time into what I wear. I want to look nice and put-together without fretting over my wardrobe. These tees help with just that!I\u2019m 5\u20196,\u201d 125 pounds, 28G bra, 36-25-39 measurementsPros:- Long: I have larger breasts and a smaller waist and most shirts simply dont come down enough in the front for my comfort. These do!- Stretch: there is just enough give to give me the form-fit I\u2019m looking for but not enough that it over-stretched to look frumpy- Bright Color: super white! I love how bright and true-white it is! I\u2019m currently working on perfecting my washing routine to make these shirts stay ultra white.- Opaque: I can wear this shirt over a nude bra and there\u2019s no seeing through it. As I\u2019m wearing them primarily in the summer and I over-hear easily, this was a huge plus for me!- Inexpensive: Depending on the buyer, I can purchase one between $4.50 and $5.00 a shirt. That\u2019s a great price for such a functional piece!- Higher V: The v neck isn\u2019t so low that I have to wear an undershirt to feel modest. Again, just a nude bra under it and I feel comfortable!Cons:- Could be considered \u201cfast fashion\u201d: This is an inexpensively manufactured, imported product. Ideally I would be purchasing Made in America products only as they tend to last longer and discourage unethical business practices overseas.- Tan not Zenana brand: When purchased in the 4-pack, the tan shirt was a different brand.If this review was helpful, please click \u201chelpful.\u201d All reviews are my own and I am never compensated for my opinion. If I reviewed it, I bought it!",
            "Buy bigger than you think you'll need. These are comfortable and cottony/spandex-y. Exactly what I was looking for.UPDATE: I liked the FIRST shipment I received. The second shipment I received was awful. I hit the button that said place your order again, and what i received were TENTS. I cannot wear them. They are not the SAME shirts I purchased 2 weeks ago. They even have different tags, they feel like thin cheap material and I am HIGHLY UPSET. They don't even feel like the same shirt I described above. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE more that ONCE, they'll sent you CRAP the second time.UPDATE: NOW they sent me an email ACKNOWLEDGING that they purposely sent me the wrong items because the ones I wanted were currently out of stock. But, they'll give me refund IF I send back the items. They wasted my time and money knowing that I wasn't going to be satisfied with my order, but did it anyways. SNEAKY, DISHONEST, WASTED MY TIME. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE TO BUY ANYTHING. I AM FURIOUS",

I wore a large but would need to buy a 1X. I've gained a little weight since last purchasing, so decided to size up one size and get a 2X. This company must have fixed their sizing issues because the 2X is huge on me. I'm glad they fixed their sizing but this is still disappointing. Main reason for 1 star, I ordered a 4 pack but only received 2 shirts. Not impressed.",

When I opened the package the barcode sticker read correctly, however, what I received was a 4-pack of Active Brand shirts and 2 of the colors were NOT correct nor did the description of how they fit match.  DON'T buy these!!",
            "Like others mentioned, I recommend you to get bigger size. I usually wear M but ordered L and fits perfectly and comfortable.  I could see through my bra when I tried light gray one but that's easy fix if you wear nude color bra. Darker color ones were no see through.",
            "Overall, the shirts are comfortable and that is what I was going for. I purchased these T-shirts to wear post-partum for nursing and comfort while I lost my baby weight. I purchased them in Mediums. They guit perfect. I'm 5'2\" and they're a bit longer, which I like. They are nice and thick in quality. I definitely recommend the buy, however, be aware of a few things:-Shipping is slow, in spite of claiming Prime 2-day, it took 2 or more weeks for these to arrive.  On two separate occasions, as I have ordered twice.- The styles vary a bit. Some are genuine short-sleeved styles, while others are longer. They are somewhat awkward as to where the sleeve hem rests. Mid-biceps.-Colors are different than pictured.  The yellow appears to be a soft tone, but is more of a school bus yellow. The teal is more of an understated blue. I have yet to get other colors.-Sizes were mixed, even though I purchased size medium. I got smalls as well. Which I am okay with, as they both fit and these were purchased for nursing and to wear as I lose my baby weight."

            "Bought this for the Fourth of July. I\u2019m a patriot but I abhor the current political climate of America. What I love about this shirt is that it singlehandedly (pun intended) takes us to the point of it all. Peace. I am typically a medium (38/33/46) in shirts. I ordered a small and fit like a medium.",
            "I bought both the small and the medium because I can be between sizes. Medium shown in photo (washed and dried in high heat 2x).I am 5\u20195\u2019, 140-145lbs (depending on how much pizza I ate the night before!), 34B+/C-, pear shape.The small fit pretty well. I did feel that the armpits came up a little too high. But it was a nice fitted tank other than that. The reason I didn\u2019t keep it is I was afraid it would shrink in which case it would then be too tight and most likely cut hard into my armpits. I\u2019m sending this back.The medium has me feeling a little like Goldilocks, because it\u2019s just a bit too big. The medium fits a little bit closer to a large. The arm holes on it are pretty loose and baggy.  And it\u2019s a bit too long. However I chose to keep the medium for a few reasons. 1) I felt if it shrank a little in the wash it would probably fit just like I was looking for \u2013 \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t really shrink much unfortunately. 2) I\u2019m buying it for two outdoor Florida pool/beach parties for the Fourth of July. In case you\u2019re not aware, it\u2019s darn hot in Florida. I didn\u2019t want something too fitted - for this case, a bit baggy as a swim cover essentially is ok. 3) I really like the print, and I really didn\u2019t want to look for anything else\u2026All in all I think this will work well for my purpose, but if I was using it for a standard every day tank it\u2019s probably just a tad too large.",

This was true to size (an actual large), but it still looks cute with shorts or even as a beach coverup. The print is high quality and has lasted several washings so far. I get nothing but compliments on this shirt!",

Had I gone up to a Medium, the overall shirt would have been too wide. I returned this item...",

I read multiple reviews on here saying the sizing ran a little bigger than expected..so although I normally get tanks in medium, i got this one in a small and it fits perfect! I like that the fit on the bottom of the shirt is loose/flowy. Excellent quality and very cute \ud83d\ude0a",

It did fit larger than expected, I usually wear s/m so I ordered medium hoping it would fit a bit loose. It actually fits more like a medium/ large.

            "Great top! Tons of compliments when I wore it.",
            "This top is super cute. The pink on it is a little brighter than pictured but it\u2019s cute. The material is slightly stretchy so there is some give. I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d, 160lbs and ordered a large and it fits great. Great shirt for the price",

            "Ordered a medium size, which easily fit my chest, but was close on the waist.  You know...measure twice and cut once.I noticed the weight guidelines, and I did not fall into them.  I am greasy, short, and fat.  5'7\" &amp; 175 lbsI should have heeded those guidelines more carefully, because, as expected, the cut is a more athletic fit.Ah well, my bad.  A medium would have been the right size, if I didn't look like I was smuggling a watermelon..A larger size would look silly, it would be too long and be far too large around the chest.If I can do 200,000,000 crunches before July, I might be able to wear it this season...I'm on #5, so wish me luck.I would order again, easily, though at a different weight.I wish the shorts were a bit shorter.  I'm short so they just about reach my knees.  I suppose I could hem them easily.",
            "It fits perfectly. It has the elastic around the waist which is a life saver. *This company has the correct fitting jumpsuit. Others dont have the elastic! Pay the extra to make sure you get the item that actually fits!!!",
            "I think rompers for men were in fashion a few years ago, so I was really curious when I saw these on Amazon. I decided to pull the trigger since I wanted to be adventurous with my fashion and step out of my comfort zone.I\u2019m a smaller frame (I wear XS a lot) so the fit was a bit bigger on me. It\u2019s made of a nylon material so it definitely doesn\u2019t breathe. Probably not great in really hot weather, but the benefit is that you can fully unzip in the front for a slightly sexy look. The downside for me was there was a strong plastic smell when it came out of the bag.Let\u2019s be real here though. These aren\u2019t everyday clothes. Hahah. You\u2019re not gonna be able to wear some of the patterns often, and this was more of a gag gift/costume for me.For what it was and what I expected out of this outfit, it\u2019s a solid romper!",
            "The shape is a bit boxy and there\u2019s not much of a waist but I used a fanny pack as a belt and it ended up being fantastic for Pride. I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d and 130 lbs and a small fit really well.",

Also, the romper is just too long -- for a medium, I would have expected a shorter torso portion.  The design is fun, but for something that I'll wear a couple of times a year at most, $40 seems like too much.",
            "My husband and I wore these to San Francisco pride and we were basically celebrities all weekend.  There are a hit, comfortable and fit as I expected.  I am 5'9, 200lbs and a large was perfect even a little roomy. The pockets are a little shallow but I used a wallet case on my iphone and that is all I carried which worked great. If you wear the \"jazz\" aka free water cup print be ready for random strangers asking to take pictures with you.",

            "Bought this as a gag-gfit for my husband and it was hilarious. My girlfriends and I all got them for our husbands who are friends (we have an inside running joke about rompers).

            "HOW ARE PEOPLE SAYING TO SIZE UP?! I have a large bust (everything, actually) and went by the chart and this is humongous! Misleading reviews (!!!) along with the description convinced me the sizing was not US so I ordered the size I buy for China sizing (4x.) Do not do this. I am usually a 1x, sometimes a 2x depending on the cut of the shirt since I am apple shaped, but as you can see in the picture I can fit a whole 'nother me in this thing, and that is no small feat.I will say the material is very silky and flowy, seems like it would be cool and comfortable, and the cut does seem like it will be flattering once I have my right size. I will exchange and then update my rating.**Edit: Exchanged and updated my rating to four stars since the straps are shorter than what I'd like, bit closer to the armpits than what I'd prefer, but not painful. Got a 1x and it fits well, still very flowy and comfy, more than long enough to cover button and fly on pants. Buy your normal size, folks.",

Plus length is great, past belly to cover any hang. Lol.Not sure how the fabric will hold up once washed. I plan to gentle cycle and hang dry.",
            "Fits perfectly and the material is so soft and comfy :)",
            "This top is smaller than the other top I ordered earlier in the same size (2X), which indicates customers can't count on consistency in sizing.  This newer top is also shorter in length. Both tops are wearable but I like the loose, longer fit of the first top better. It almost feels like there is a full size difference but the tags indicate they are the same size. Weird.",
            "Very nice top. I went by the size chart first and my first try was way too big, I went a size down and it is comfortable.",
            "This is the second tank top by Joelly I've purchased, and I love these. They are lightweight and very comfortable. The fit is loose but cut so it doesn't look like a bag, which is very much appreciated! The fabric is a very smooth polyester, and the print is really cute! The only drawback is that the bottom edge is not properly hemmed so it rolls up a little, I'm casually dressed most of the time so I don't think this is very obvious in what I wear, but if you're looking for a polished look this might turn you off. Overall, this is a very comfortable cute tank top, perfect for the summer!"

            "It is an OK bra. I recently discovered that I've been wearing wrong size bras, so I did an extensive shopping for new ones. Instead of this bra I would recommend:Maidenform Comfort Devotion Demi (both Embellished and not)Maidenform Smooth ComfortWarner's Your BraIf you like some extra padding (not as in push up, just a little extra in the cup bottom) Maidenform Natural Boost Demi is very nice.All of the above are much softer all over - the cups, the straps, the band. Compared to them this bra feels somewhat stiff.",
            "I wouldn't even give this bra a star if I didn't have to. I don't understand. I bought this exact same bra a year ago and it was amazing. I opened up my package today and this bra is thin, flimsy, and cheap looking. It's not even really nude it's like a white nude. What happened? Please send me a new one that is better so I can update this review. Bc I really do love Maidenform. But this bra was extremely disappointing. And frankly a waste of money.",
            "I bought the white bra before a trip and it fit PERFECTLY. Most comfortable bra I've worn. I loved it so much I bought one in black from the same seller, in the same size. I was incredibly disappointed by the black bra. Both items have the same description and brand (Maidenform one fab fit t-shirt bra), and yet if you look at the photos I submitted there is a HUGE size discrepancy. Both are supposedly 36DD, and yet the band on the black bra is an entire 1.5 inches shorter! I am going to need to exchange the black for a longer band unfortunately. Also the fact that the labels are completely different for the same model makes me wonder about the authenticity of the brand. One is made in Bangladesh, the other in El Salvador. One has (R) by the brand name (white bra) and the other (TM/MC) (black bra) which leads me to believe the black one is a knock-off.",
            "I bought this in the black with the heart print.  I bought the Maidenform women\u2019s natural boost Demi bra (different style) at the same time. Comparing the two,  this bra is much more cheaply made then the natural boost demi bra.  The bra fit perfectly, and the print is cute. However, the fabric doesn\u2019t feel as silky as the natural boost Demi bra by Maidenform.  The sides of this bra are not lined, but the natural boost Demi bra is. They are both about the same price. I am going to return this one and get another natural boost Demi bra. One upside to this bra is that it has minimal padding, so it feels very natural. The natural boost Demi bra has a little bit more padding, but not too much in my opinion. But when I put on the other bra, it felt luxurious. When I put on this bra, it felt cheap.Another bra I bought at the same time that feels luxurious and has the more subtle padding like this bra is the Calvin Klein demi bra. It it lovely and about the same price as well. All from Amazon!",
            "Giving 3 stars due to inconsistent sizing. The one bra that did fit gets 5 stars. I was delighted to see these here after buying one at a store. I ordered black, blush, Moroccan blue, and beige. Sadly, only the Moroccan blue bra fit perfectly like the one I bought in store. The others were made of different materials that were not as comfortable and the bands were actually much shorter (I'm talking 1-2\" difference). I would have needed to use those extenders at the biggest setting to be able to wear them, so I returned the 3 that were unbearably tight. The Amazon refund was speedy and return shipping was indeed free, so those were pluses. It's unfortunate that the sizing is so inconsistent because when you do happen upon one that actually fits as it should, these are really comfortable.",
            "Maidenform style #7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape.  I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price.  I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store.  This new style is an oddly molded half bra that doesn't look natural under clothing - creating points where there shouldn't be any.  I've worn the same size and style for many years, and this product did not live up to the standard.",
            "Yes, it fits well and looks good but one of the two bras I ordered was too scratchy to wear- threads were bunched up in the back strap at one place which made it unbearable after a few hours of wear. When I went to return this bra (and keep the other), I discovered that not only was there no free return shipping but that there is a \"15% restocking fee\" that makes the bra not worth returning.",
            "I recently discovered I was wearing the wrong bra size. I never understood how women could be so unaware of something so crucial, but I, too, was way off. I was wearing a 36B, switched to a 36C, and presto -- the urge to rip off my bra and throw it across the room was gone!I cherish bras that disappear under my clothing and are good for all-day wear, and these fit the bill quite nicely. The straps are easily adjusted -- just move the little adjuster forward on the strap toward the cup, and the strap lengthens. I have a wide, strong torso, and this accommodates it beautifully.I first bought a beige and black one, and recently added the python patterned one to my brassiere collection. I tend to hand wash my bras, so I cannot speak to how these bras' cups hold up in the washing machine. I do own products that encapsulate bras in the wash so their shape is maintained, and I've had luck with those, so purchase one if you are concerned (I think I have a \"Bra Buddy\" -- picked it up at the State Fair of Texas years ago). Also, they break in easy rather than remaining stiff for a time like some DKNY and Calvin Klein bras do (and I ADORE CK bras after I wear them for awhile, but it's a fact -- their bras' bands are not always as malleable as I'd prefer). After the second or third time wearing it, it feels like it's always been your bra. I appreciate the lack of needless lace and silly embellishments that only make it lumpy under my clothing.I'll be checking back to see if more patterns in size 36C come back in stock. I am extremely satisfied. No longer do I groan when I have to put it on in the morning, nor do I immediately remove it as I leave work and begin my commute home.",
            "First of all this is the first time since I can remember that I really do have a need for a bra. I have been very, very \u2018small\u2019 and could get away with wearing just a camisole under a top (sometimes not even that). For years I used to hate wearing a bra, perhaps it was a result of my not buying the correct size and style. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d and about 103 pounds - give or take a couple and do need some coverage on the top. This style was the first one I tried and I used the sizing that was given to find my correct size (34C). I didn\u2019t realize it was an underwire bra but when I tried it on the wire didn\u2019t even feel uncomfortable. I liked this bra style so much that I bought several additional ones (all in basic colors like black, white, nude, navy). The style is cut low and I guess that\u2019s the reason it\u2019s called a t-shirt bra. The shoulder straps are adjustable and the clasp in the back has 3 different positions, depending on how \u2018wide\u2019 you need it to be (for me I was most comfortable with it on the first clasp, making it the widest). I won\u2019t even say how much (or how little!) these cost - at least when I bought them. There isn\u2019t anything that I would consider negative and would definitely recommend this style for everything, not only t-shirts!",
            "Cute bra.  Love the polka-dots.  I ordered it to replace a similar Maidenform model which I could not find in the correct size.  This bra is slightly smaller in fit than the other slightly different models I was replacing and that I ordered at the same time.  Both the band and the cups are smaller than expected, but not so much that I can't wear it.  Although it won't be my favorite."

Not too tight across the bust and flows over stomach issues that I prefer to hide. The arm holes are not too large and not too tight.  I encourage others to give this shirt a chance and just buy it.",

I also really did not find the cut at the bottom attractive.  Also it is form fitting around my stomach also a area I am not trying to highlight.  I am going to keep it but am having it altered."

            "I bought this for my sons iPhone and he accidentally dropped it on his bedroom floor and it cracked with the case on it. This is a expensive phone case and this shouldn\u2019t happen. Not impressed",
            "UPDATE 5.10.19After the rubber piece came out, the rubber film over the home button also ripped. I contacted their customer service for a warranty replacement and they sent one out right away, I just had to pay the $5-ish dollar shipping fee. Since receiving that new case mid February 2019, that case has cracked upon a drop (the plastic casing part on the front of the phone and the cover on the charging port is bent and won\u2019t snap closed.  I contacted customer service for another warranty claim and they\u2019re sending another out for just the cost of shipping, which is about $7-ish this time. Customer service has been great, but I\u2019d rather just have a case that doesn\u2019t fall apart.ORIGINAL:This is a good, durable case. Has protected my phone a lot, however, the little rubber piece that goes into the bottom to protect the seal where you charge the phone is removable.  I bought this because my daughter kept throwing my phone in the pool. It does work great, even for durability if dropped on the ground. I only knocked it down one star because that rubber piece (which is extremely important) does come out AND people complain about not being able to hear me very well on the phone.",

            "Love this item! Having a pink phone means you want to see your phone color. The regular lifeproof Fre cases do not allow you to see the color of your phone because it\u2019s fully covers it. I like that this has the clear background, allowing me to see the actual color of the phone that I selected. I do wish that the case came in pink to match my phone, but the purple is close enough. I do recommend getting yourself a screen protector since this does not cover the screen from any scratches.",
            "this is the 3rd lifeproof product that I have purchased. the last cases were perfect!  But now, It broke at the bottom where you insert the cable to charge......I am very disappointed for I have only owned it for 5 weeks...\u2026.I had loved all my previous ones for I am a serious hiker and am outdoors in all 4 seasons. It can not be used near any water or wet conditions. \u2026\u2026.I need to return this faulty item.... not manufactured well.  the old ones were better.....I expect it to be replaced asap.",
            "Not quite what I expected, very difficulty to put on and take off. One side \"squeaks\" and doesn't feel like it fits exactly right which makes me concerned about how waterproof it will be.

Some grains of dirt did make its way into the back of the case when I would forget to close the charge port door and it etched small digits into the case and phone but that was my fault. Highly recommend this case and the glass screen protector that fits this case. Can\u2019t remember the brand name (tequila?). I work in construction so a sealed/shock proof case was very important to me.",
            "This is my first LifeProof product. I had read good reviews about it when I bought it. I have had this product for the last 7 months now. The case is good from protection perspective, however, the voice is muffled when put on speaker phone. Also, the material is not that great. The lid which closes the charging enclosure broke off. They should have constructed the case with better material. I don\u2019t know how this will get covered under basic manufacturer\u2019s warranty since it\u2019s just about 7 months old.",
            "Wouldn\u2019t buy it again. It\u2019s great that the phone was protected but when the case is on no one can hear me on the other end if the phone was on speaker phone (which I use a lot) and I could not use FaceTime.  Had more sound issues than just that. Extremely hard to take on and off so I couldn\u2019t take it off every time I needed to have a phone call or FaceTime so just ended up taking it off for good. Really wanted to love it because it looked good and protected the phone but it just didn\u2019t do it for me"

My son is 31 inches tall and 20 lbs 8 ounces so the onesie though it does fit I can see that he won\u2019t be able to use it for long. The shorts however will last a while longer then the onesie. The shoes fit well with some room for his feet to grow in. His feet are 5 inches long (just measured), so I\u2019d say the shoe size is about 5.5 inches long. Here\u2019s a pic so you can check out if it\u2019ll work for you.",

Shoes dont have any grip on the bottom but I find this appropriate as I purchased this in size 6-9 months. If you were buying for one of walking age I would just caution as the shoes could be slippery for them. That being said the shoes are abdolutely the cutest piece, very stylish. We have been very happy with this purchase.",

Had to order a 9-12 month size and it is still a little big but he will grow into it. However, the shoes now won\u2019t fit because they are too small. He needed the shoes from the 18 month option, but the outfit from the 9-12 month option but since everything is tagged together, I won\u2019t be able to get him the proper combination of sizes. So I have to basically buy the set for the clothes but the shoes are useless.",

            "After a month of use the screen cracked in the corner. It was not immediately after a fall but there had been a fall from about 3 feet the day prior onto the corner of the case.I've had Otterboxes on all my phones since the HTC HD2. In over a decade of using OtterBox cases this is the first one I've had a phone break and the first time I've been disappointed in my purchase.I feel that each generation of Defender cases has been cheaper and flimsier. This one seems to have pinched the screen so much that it cracked as there is hard plastic on each side of the corner with no padding material.",
            "I have always had Otterbox Defender cases on all of my phones because they had a built in screen protector. When I was looking at the Otterbox Defender for the Note 8 I saw that it did not have a built in screen protector and instead had tempered glass to be used with the case. When I ordered I thought that this would be ok. I received my order and put the phone in the case and installed the glass and the screen. Sensitivity with the Alpha Glass was horrible. So I tried 2 other screen protectors, glass and plastic film, neither worked for me. So I have ended up going with a different case.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075277YQY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1This is a great alternative to the mistake that Otterbox decided to make. This case includes a built in screen protector. I have not noticed any screen sensitivity lose with the screen protector that is built into this case.Otterbox made a huge mistake by not including built in screen protectors with their most current cases. I hope they get the clue and decide to start including them again.",
            "I expect better from Otterbox.This is the first time I have written a negative review for an Otterbox product. I thought that perhaps I got a bad one, so I bought a second one.I had the same exact issue on both of these.After a few months of use on a Samsung Note 8, with no overheating issues, the rubber in the case stretched to where it no longer fit the phone. It became loose and unsightly.I'm very careful to prevent overheating issues, so I always use good chargers, and keep an eye on the heat of the phone. No issues there, and no abuse of the phone or case.Clearly this is a design and production flaw in this model.It will protect your phone, but after a few months, it looks quite odd and keeps slipping off at the camera part.There are many cheaper cases that will protect your phone and don't have these types of issues. For the price, Otterbox needs to do better.",
            "I've been using otter box for all my phones the last few years and am very happy because I tend to drop my phone a lot, it really protects like it's supposed to. This new model doesn't have the plastic front see through cover and I actually like it better this way. My old phone had the cover and if it got dirty or scratched, it was annoying taking it apart to clean, eventually the plastic became dull to see through and couldn't be removed. I also like that the otter box helps me avoid from touching the screen accidentally, it's flush with the phone but its sleek design keeps it from feeling bulky like older models.",
            "Love this case. I bought a cheapo one before this and cracked my $1000 phone.  Thankfully i had insurance.  This time i splurged for the otterbox. It is sleek and pretty and fits perfect.  I have dropped it a couple times (minimal drops from the couch or slipped from my hand) and no breaks scratches or cracks anywhere.  Only complaint would be like everyone else: no screen protector. You have to buy separate, and the reviews were so bad I didn't want to waste another $60. The defender always came with total screen protection what gives now? I purchased an off brand through Amazon, and it has taken 3 different purchases to buy one that fits correctly on the phone and with the case.",
            "I'll give Otterbox 5 stars for the case but 1 star for the holster for an average of 3 stars overall.The case fits well and the buttons work fine.  The case feels like it would provide some good cushioning if the phone dropped on a corner.  I'm not bothering with a screen protector for this phone because of the curved screen.  Seems like a lot are having problems and I'm just not up for trying to figure out which one works.Now the holster just plain sucks.  Flimsy.  When the phone is locked into the holster and you squeeze them both to remove from your belt the holster flexes so much that it almost touches the screen.  And there's no soft padding of any kind on the inside of the holster.  Poor design.  I tried to fix this by sticking some foam (~1/8\" thick) on the holster so that the soft felt would contact the screen instead but it started leaving smudges.  I didn't know if over time it would leave a mark on the screen so I stopped using it.  Can't return it so I will just use the case alone.  Come on, Otterbox, stop cheaping out and fix the holster.  Seriously.  I'm disappointed because I've been an Otterbox fan for years.",

            "THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST YOURSELF AND THE NOT SO SMART MOVES YOU MAKE.  The Otter Box saved my brand new Galaxy Note 8 when I forgot to grab my phone off the top of my car after loading up a ton of stuff after holiday shopping (needed a free hand and told myself multiple times....dont forget to grab it).  Yeah....so much for listening to myself.  Smashed to the ground 100 yds down the road after hitting a bump.  O. M. G.  The tiniest Road burn in the top left corner.  No cracks, dents, shrapnel,....nothing.  Lost the S-pen when it popped out and got run over.  The Alpha Glass protective screen cover took the brunt.....completely shattered.  The phone.....not a scratch....just the S-pen.  Had heard this was one of the best..... I AM A BELIEVER!!!!!!!  Lifetime fan of the Otter Box club now.  Thank you for creating such an amazing product.",
            "Disappointed in this case. The belt clip feels more flimsy than previous models. The clip mechanism for the phone is weak. Not only is it difficult to tell if the phone is properly clipped in, but even if it is clipped in well, the slightest jolt will send the phone flying out of the clip. The fingerprint reader and pulse sensor are placed in a deep recess, making it difficult to use them. Only reason it got more than one star is that it's still more durable than other cases.",
            "I wanted a lighter colored case so it would be more easily visible in my purse ... without it being pink or some tacky gold. With a limited selection I selected the orchid/gray one.I got a BLACK one. Yeah, deep, dark invisible in my purse BLACK.I was hesitant about buying another Otter box since the reason I needed a new phone via insurance rather than warranty was because when I took the Otter box off my maybe 2 year old phone with the poor battery life the entire back was shattered - like spider veins - I think Otter box owes ME $112 - the cost to replace my phone. I took a deep breath and bought the Defender instead of another POS Commuter-. But honestly all the reviews for other cases were OH, I love it or Oh its a piece of crap . . . Why on earth phones are made so fragile that they need to be encased in bubble wrap then won't fit in your pocket and weigh a ton is a true conundrum"

I\u2019m 5\u20199 so this could just be an issue for me, but keep it in mind if you\u2019re tall and like longer shirts.

I got the white, which I think would look better fitted. I think the black or gray would look better as a t shirt. Worst thing: The sleeves are not cuffed like the picture.

            "If you have had a commuter series before you can expect the same with this one. I don't feel the rubber is as dense as previous phone models. There also is zero texture on the plastic sides. I would have like to see otterbox put some sort of edges or grip to it. As it stands this case is EXTREMELY slippery.Fits perfect and has raised bumpers for it if falls on its face. No problem with charging cables fitting. I need to test the wireless charging capability and will update my review.[Update] worked with Samsung branded wireless charger. No issues wireless charging",
            "OtterBox makes quality cases for phones, this one isn't an exception. The most important factor with a phone case is protection of the phone around the corner edges, OtterBox cases do a great job of that. The Commuter series cases are simple - 2-piece cases, soft/silicone rubber for the inner case which wraps around the phone, then a hard case that covers the back. I prefer the hard shell on the exterior because the phone slides in and out of pocket easier. I had the Defender case for my S8+ which had a silicone exterior and plastic shell interior, the Commuter case is definitely less bulky overall. I don't see the Defender and Commuter styles all that different as far as protection of the phone.Easy to install, fits the phone like a precision-made glove, and it's easy to remove/keep clean. This case also allows for easier installation of tempered glass screen protectors since there's not a hard plastic interior frame that pushes against the screen protector. Any of the OtterBox cases are well worth it for protecting your investment, considering these phones have price tags in the $900-$1000 range.",
            "Otterbox is a well-known name in the phone case business. They are known for being highly protective, but I\u2019ve noticed over the yrs their quality and durability has decreased big time. The phone was in this case and in the breast pocket of a nomax uniform, and when I tripped and fell (the phone stayed in my pocket and didn\u2019t fall out or anything) I checked the phone and it was shattered terribly. Have had many issues lately with other otterboxes (symmetry, commuters, etc) NOT protecting my familys\u2019 devices from falls that other cheaper, seemingly less protective cases have withstood.",
            "I have owned many OtterBox cases over the years. From the original Defender for my iPhone 3gs, to this case for my gf's new Galaxy S9+. I have also owned many other cases along the way, in an attempt to find a good alternative to OtterBox. For my own Galaxy S9+, I actually use a Lifeproof FRE. While it is nice if you need one totally water sealed, the material quality cannot come close to OtterBox (not to mention OB is cheaper!). All in all, this Commuter was in very simply packaging, and was removed and installed in under a minute. I'd call that a win.",
            "Love the color.  It compliments the Coral Blue Galaxy9+ extremely well.  The only drawback to the Galaxy is the lack of pretty cases (iphone has tons).  So pleased with this case.  Doesn't add much bulk but enough to actually have something to hang on to.  Doesn't interfere with the fingerprint capabilities.  Will be adding a tempered glass protector and attempting wireless charging.  If either of these don't work with this case I will update accordingly.",
            "It's a good thing this case is rugged! The back is so smooth that it sometimes slides out of my hand, as if maybe Otterbox wants to prove it will protect my phone by making it easy to drop! But on the other hand it slides very easily in and out of my pocket. So what can I say?I had this same series case on a Galaxy S7 for 3 years, no issues, multiple drops. One time I left the phone on my trunk lid and drove off. Went back and there was my phone, face down on asphalt, without a scratch or crack.Would give 5 stars if there was just a little more rubber up and down the sides instead of hard plastic.",
            "like all otterboxes i have owned, it works very well. they are super expensive, especially for what they are, but i also don't upgrade my phone every year. i think this is the 4th phone i have put an otterbox on and i have not had to replace a phone due specifically to the fact that i always have an otterbox on my phone. i was also a bit worried with this phone due to the curved screen silliness that samsung is on, but this case works well even with that stupid phone feature.",
            "I wanted a thinner case that was still very protective. This case is working well. I've dropped my phone a few times, and it's kept my phone safe. The case hasn't cracked either.There is some slight discoloration around the rubber parts of the case (if you look at the product picture, it's the darker colored part of the case). I put it in my back pocket and in my purse a lot, so I think it's from that. Not that big of a deal, just wanted to share because it does make the case look a bit dirty.",
            "Great product. My wife tosses it on my head when I'm too engaged with TV and while I get bumps the size of eggs on my head, my phone remains intact and protected, which is great. It is sleek and stylish too. I recommend you buy this for your phone, and if you are married, choose the otterbox case and helmet combo.",
            "My 2 sons are frequently grabbing (and often dropping) my phone. The case provides durability and protection without compromising the screen.I wish there were more color choices."

            "This tank top is PERFECT for the 4th of July! I bought this last year and am planning to wear it again this year. I washed and dried the garment more than once and it didn't fade. I am 5'7\", 120 lbs and a small fit me perfect. Fits true to size. The fit is a just a little forming fitting but very flattering. Very comfortable fabric. Lower cut. Love the distressed flag. All over great quality, I would recommend this product!",
            "The shirt is comfortable and very appropriate for 4th of July, and regular wear! I gave it 3 stars because it is not the same as the item pictures. Flag covers the entire front of the shirt. See my picture vs. example photo.",
            "First let me say I'm 5'10\" tall and a size 8. I usually wear medium shirts. I ordered this in a large. It's snug. The material is VERY form fitting. Even ordering an extra large would have produced the same result with a wider cut at the arms and shoulders. Because of the material, the shirt can't \"hang.\"  I dislike my clothes that tight. Every imperfection shows!  I'm Sorry I bought it.",
            "Its okay but I wouldn't buy it again. I am 5'2'' and 135 lbs, I carry some extra weight in my stomach, so I bought a large hoping it would be forgiving. I usually wear medium tops. But this was just too tight. It accentuated my stomach. I won't wear it out but for the price, I added it to my pajama drawer. My advice would be if you buy it just go up a couple of sizes if you don't want to accentuate your stomach.",
            "I like this shirt, however the flag does not look as it appears on the picture. The flag is almost the entire tank top, not part of it. Also I saw the sizing people said it ran small, but I thought it actually ran big and wish I would have just gotten my normal size (I usually get a small, but got a medium). It's a little big but after a couple washes/drys maybe it will be better, but it's still cute and wearable, just baggier than I would normally wear but I got it for a work out tank/race so it's not a big deal. It's a cute shirt!",
            "The overall quality of the top is good, however, the print is a full plastic print and super stiff. I washed it, hoping it would soften a little, but instead it all wrinkled up and started cracking. I have the exact same top in black, and it has a completely different print, in fabric and softer. I assume they\u2019re using different production centers, which is unfortunate, since you assume the same quality  when you order the same product.",
            "The shirt was too large for me, had to return it. The flag on the front was a plastic-film like print, and was very stiff. I have other shirts from this provider that I love - but the American flag on the front of this shirt was too stiff for me, and didn't allow the shirt to flow freely. The flag was also a lot larger on the shirt than it appears in the pictures.",

I think it will still fit her, but it will be tight especially if it shrinks a little bit in the wash. A safer bet would've been to order a medium. But the design is really cute and she's pumped to wear it during the Olympics!",
            "I've bought a total of four of these tanks (two for myself and two for my husband). The material is of good quality. It doesn't shrink in the dryer and the image hasn't faded or flaked after numerous washings."

            "I had such a tough time deciding between this tee and the \"Meowica\" one that I ended up buying both! I love that I purchased an XL and it is soft, flowy and comfortable. I know a lot of ladies like form fitting clothes, but some of us are hellbent on comfort and maybe hiding some trouble areas, so this is perfect for a person who will be outside in the sun all day on the 4th.For sizing: I wear a an XL up top (because boobs, man) and this fit just fine over my breasts while still providing nice comfort on my stomach and hips.",
            "Funny shirt. Great for 4th of July! I am 5\u20199 140lbs I ordered a medium. I usually like shirts with a little extra room, not tight on my tummy.  The medium is just slightly snugger than I would like.",
            "Super cute for Fourth of July. As other reviews said it does run big, that\u2019s why I felt confident ordering it since I typically wear a 3X. Fit exactly like I anticipated it would so I was very pleased!!",
            "Cute top, very comfy, and a little looser than I expected but that\u2019s probably not a bad thing! I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d, 125lbs, 34D\u2019s and I ordered a small.",
            "I had a really hard time with sizing for this tank. I read multiple reviews on different sights and finally settled on going with my normal size, XL. The tank fit and it was a little bigger than the other style I ordered from this company. I almost wish I would have gone a size up to have the loose tank look. The design was just as pictured too (Dibs). I felt like the material was a little heavier than I would have liked. I planned on wearing it for 4th of July in 90 degree weather. I ended up not wearing and returning. Overall the quality was good.",

I love the length, it covers half my butt and my hips. If you are not one who likes to show cleavage as I am myself, especially when bending over to deadlift, be prepared and wear a higher cut tank or bandeau top underneath, its kind of low cut. The picture on the front is printed clearly and makes me smile to see when I pass by the mirror.",

            "Ive been trying to find a comfortable soft tank for the last 6 months. The quality of this feels like Theory or Vince! Its amazing! I just came back to buy more but they are out of my size!! Get it while you can, I've been checking back every few days for it to come back in stock, thats how good it is.",
            "Pros: Great simple tops that are a current stape for my work wardrobe. They are so soft (like pajamas!), nice cut V neck (not too deep), and fit well. I usually buy a Small in tops (I'm a 4 or 6), but I bought the mediums for a loose flowing tunic fit to go with black skinny pants and jeans.Cons: This fabric can easily pill, and picks up lint easily. I took off one star because I find if I wear any jewelry that touches the fabric, that it pills around the neck. It also can look like the fabric is not clean because of how easily lint, hair, anything seems to be attracted to it.Style Idea: I pair the black top with a \"Stretch is Comfort\" black Modal Skirt (also bought on amazon), for a very comfortable, nice looking versitle outfit that you can dress up or down. They feel like business pajamas :).  The modal skirt doesn't pill as much, but that brand doesn't make the same style tops like this.",
            "I'm 145 lbs 5'1\" double d....I'm usually a medium (size 6-8) but after reading reviews, I ordered a large and fits perfect in this, not too tight over tummy. Not too loose in arms/bust. Ordered in black.  Great toddler mommy uniform with leggings or jeans.  Soft, breathable. At only $10 each I'll probably order more.",
            "It's so hard to find a tank that's not super form fitting or with a wide strap. I bought these as lounge/pajamas but I can already tell I'll be wearing them out. Great soft material. Good for larger chested women and good length (somewhere between a long tee and a tunic). Could easily be worn with a fancy necklace or dressed down with short. So versatile and price is right!",
            "It\u2019s hard to find tanks that aren\u2019t too loose under the arms or boxy because I\u2019m petite and small chested. (I\u2019m 5\u20191 weigh 115 32B cup) I ordered a XS and they fit very well. I also like they aren\u2019t too low cut and the straps are wide. My job is laid back so I plan on wearing these with nice earrings or a necklace during the summer months but could easily throw on with shorts for casual wear too.",
            "The fabric is substantial - very thick, not revealing.  Definitely quality.  The bottom hem is also cute.  However, after trying both the Small and Extra Small, I realized it's not cut for broad-chested women (I don't mean bra size - I mean more in the armpits and shoulders, if you're muscular.)  It cuts into your armpits.",
            "I'm 5\"-2\" 145 lbs and ordered a size medium. Great cut and fit!  The armholes are not too big for a change and the material is silky soft but not flimsy. I love the rounded hem in the back, it seems like it will keep the top from riding up like a lot of tank tops tend to do. I don't know how it will hold up to several washes but great value for the price.",
            "These tanks are really good quality.  They are extra soft and fit true to size.  They have a bit of a swing around the waist that works well for a pear shape (I have narrow shoulders and waist with large hips, and an average size bust).  They are not sheer at all (I can wear a dark bra under the grey and it isn't see through at all).  These are excellent for wearing under cardigans and hoodies as well as on their own.  The V is the perfect depth - it doesn't gape when you bend down, making this a great and flattering mommy top.  This would work well as a workout top as well.",
            "Silky perfection.  Exactly the right weight, and for once, the armholes are nice and, uh, non-droopy, which is important if you have a big, uh, frontage.",
            "I read the reviews and wanted to love these! I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d, 105 lbs and I bought an XS. I like the overall fit (loose and not clingy), and I was looking forward to these being a staple for home, and maybe work with a cardigan or light, open sweater. However, the fabric is thin enough that I can see my bra through it (a plain, nude bra, even) - not just from the front, but the back as well. It\u2019s also low cut on me - I\u2019d have to wear a cami under it if I want to wear it anywhere but home, which kind of of defeats the purpose. They\u2019re comfortable though, so I\u2019ll keep them and just end up wearing them for summer-weight pj tops."

I do not see the need to wear anything else underneath though. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be wearing this for all types of occasions. My pictures do not do this shirt justice.

I ordered XL and it fits with ample room, but if you normally wear XL you will probably find this XL too small. It's more like a generous size 10/12 I would say. Others may disagree but I just like folks to be aware. I'm also a 34B chest size this shirt has *plenty* of room for those who are larger chested.Quality is great, colors look same in person as they do online.

            "I knew buying this to size up for the right fit. I\u2019m 5\u20193 160 and got the large. It\u2019s perfect. The only downside to these tops (the material) is they snag super easily. I wouldn\u2019t wear any sharp bracelets or rings with it to be on the safe side, I learned that the hard way! Otherwise, love it.",
            "Just what I needed to wear to church, restaurants or concerts. Can be dressed up or casual. Great value, packaged nicely. I'm usually size M or L depending on brand. Ordered Large Black. Fits great, medium gauzy weight, not too long (a plus), but not short, tired of tunic length, low neckline will wear tank, not form fitting, glad i didnt size up. 5'8\" 157lbs hope that helps.",
            "I normally wear a medium in tops but decided to get a large for length &amp; comfort. I could have done a medium too but I like it a little bigger.  I absolutely love this top. The white isn\u2019t see-through &amp; the quality is better than I expected. I found the top to be slimming &amp; easy to throw on with jeans or shorts. Definitely planning to buy more colors. Came nicely packaged too!",
            "I like the shirt. The size is true to size. Recommendations was to order a larger size. I don't recommend you ordering a larger size I purchased 2XL and I should have only purchased an extra large. I'm sure that would have fit loose as well.",
            "This top is so soft and the fit is perfect since I upsized from medium to large per comments.  But the \"light grey\" is closer to beige than grey.  I'm going to order a different color.  And maybe a long-sleeved one as well.  Update:  I received the blue-green short-sleeve and it is more green than depicted but still soft and great.  I also got the coffee long-sleeve version.  The color matches the website but the fabric is completely different.  The weave is tighter and not nearly as soft.  I still like it though so I'm keeping it.",
            "I am 3 months into maternity leave with my first baby. My wardrobe usually consists of a black tank top and black sweat pants, and I love this top because I can just throw it on over top when I need to leave the house. It's comfy and flattering and also really easy to nurse in at a great price. Also the instructions say not to put it in the dryer but I ignored that and it came out fine, if maybe a little smaller.",
            "I am 5\u20199\u201d tall, have a large frame and weight 225 pounds. I ordered the XL and it fits perfect. It\u2019s not quite as blousy and the picture, but it\u2019s fits loosely. I was worried after reading some reviews that I had ordered too small but that is not the case at all. I have been on a weight loss journey this year, and I will still be able to wear it after I\u2019ve lost some more weight. When I do lose more, I will probably have to layer it with a camisole because it may be too low- cut at that point.  The color and fabric are great!  I can\u2019t wait to wear this!"

            "Nice tank for someone who is larger and doesn't want tht tummy cling !  It fits great.  Not too tight nor too baggy. Great length.  I'm a 14. I got the XL.",
            "I ordered a single white top. It unexpectedly came with a free scrunchy, which was pretty cool. I liked the fit and the comfort of the top so I decided to order more. I thought the deal for a set of two might be better. When I got them I noticed they no longer came with a scrunchy. I also noticed they seemed bigger. I had even thought I mistakenly ordered a larger size at first. I looked more closely and the shirts have different brand names on the tags and when comparing size I would say the set of two are about a half inch or more longer than the single shirt. I ordered them for a comfy oversized tank anyway so it works. Just seems strange that the 2 pack isn't the same as the solo.",
            "Overall great tank! Great material. Just heavy enough to not be see through but not so heavy that it will be too hot in the summer. My mom just got the new cricut explorer and a heat press so I'm going toHave her personalize this for me. This tank is true to size with the only downfall being that it is just slightly too big in the arms for me. I'm nursing though and wearing full coverage bras so that might be the problem. With a lesser bra, it might not show.  The tank is semi racer back but not full racer back which is my preference. The stitching at the bottom looks solid and not like it will come unraveled as I have had happen several times recently with the more affordable solid shirts. And the hair tie is a great bonus!!! I have lots of hair and this seems like it will give me far less hair breakage than what I have been using.  I've attached a few pics! Please give me a \"helpful\" rating if my review helped you! I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review :)",
            "I was looking for something that  fell a little bit more relaxed and flowy like the description implies, however this did not fit relaxed OR flowy. True they are looser toward the bottom which is fine however I was looking for a looser fit. They'll work for wearing around the house so I'll keep them. BTW I am usually a size 16. This fit like a medium.",
            "Pros: comfy cotton, I'll be keeping as a sleep shirt...make that dress lol!Cons: I am 5'2\" and slightly overweight. Followed the size chart and ordered an XL. It skims my body but I wouldn't say it's \"flowy.\" I wouldn't wear it out in public. Also the white is completely see thru. The photo shows the hem landing about an inch above the model's crotch- on me it fell about 3\" below making it look more like a dress. If you're short like me and looking for something cool to lounge around or sleep in, this will do.",
            "I like this top for the cotton feel. Its thin enough to be cool, but doesn't make you sweat.  It fits true to size and is long enough.  I would give 5 stars but one problem!  After having my tops for about a year, almost every top I bought has small holes in the tummy area.  Not sure if from my pant's button rubbing on the shirt or the seat belt but definitely many small holes.  Its OK I wear them for everything, and for the price, one whole year works for me. I ordered more.",
            "These \"EttelLut Loose Fit Relaxed Flowy Knit Tank Top: Athletic Workout Jersey Sexy Cheap Pack\" are great thin, light-weight, loose fit tank tops, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I ordered the white/gray 2-pack and liked them so well that I ordered the same thing a second time.  While the fabric is thin, the white is not see-thru/transparent.  The arm holes are a good size (not too deep).  I wouldn't call them \"sexy\" as listed in the product title, but I wasn't looking for something sexy.  The sewn in label says \"hand wash,\" but I machine washed and dried them without a problem (perhaps a little shrinkage, but I ordered one size larger to accommodate some shrinkage, which is what I commonly do).  I'd say they're better quality than the Hanes regular-fit (not loose) tank tops I ordered that came with \"straps\" of different widths(!) and a bottom hem that fell apart in the wash (and then the thread got all tangled and knotted up other items in the wash).  I wish these Ettellut loose fit tanks came in more colors.",
            "Love these tanks! Nice material, not sheer or too thin.  I like the shape.  Looks just as pictured. Didn\u2019t shrink too much, barely noticed.  I ordered two different sizes.  small and medium.  Not knowing which would fit better for my needs.  Both fit as sized.  I did not find them to be larger around the arm pits like some reviews say.  They are long and wide at the bottom just as I needed.  I used these after mastectomy recovery to cover my apron that held my 4 drains.  Covered everything perfectly and discreetly.  I was hoping that the shoulders/neck would be wide enough to step into.  But it\u2019s not.  So I simply cut the shoulder and applied Velcro to the ends.  Perfect!  Cheaper than buying the mastectomy shirts sold!  Going to order again, these will be perfect for summer too.",
            "Wasn't sure about these tanks because Ive been mostly disappointed in tank tops ordered online, but was pleasantly surprised! The material is thin enough to be cool, but provides enough coverage that it doesn't feel like you're wearing jersey material (i.e. they don't show every outline of your waistline, pants, or leggings!). I'm 5'8\" and 140 lbs., athletic build, and am bottom heavy with wider hips. Finding long tanks that don't stretch weirdly across my hips is sometimes hard, but these are true to fit and description! They hang loose enough in the hips that it isn't tight or causing bunching at my chest in a strange way. Although they are longer and looser the neckline is flattering. The arm holes arent huge either, as sometimes happens with loose tank tops so you still get side coverage. These would be great under a blazer/ cardigan as a layering base with open front top pieces, but would probably be too bulky for underneath pullover sweaters. They would also make excellent work out tanks. I'm definitely ordering more in other colors now!"

            "My baby girl still loves to be swaddled.  At 5 months and nearly 20lbs swaddling has become increasingly more difficult.  We have lots of swaddle blankets.  Our collection includes the expensive A+A brand (both with and without bamboo) and while the A+A brand is nice and loved by many, more often than not I am pushing them aside for one of these.  Why are they better?  They wash better than other brands and are softer after multiple washes.  The ones I ordered before my daughter was born still look brand new.  These blankets are also 3 inches larger than other brands.",
            "I had had the Aiden &amp; Anais blankets for my first daughter and thought that they were absolutely amazing!  Gave them out as gifts.  When I had my second daughter recently, my older daughter would not give me the blankets back....because she needed them for her dollies, of course!!So, I bought these instead and love them!  They are bigger than the A&amp;A wraps, which I always thought were big.  This makes for an easier swaddle.  I also think that they are a tighter swaddle!!!  They do not start out as soft as the A&amp;A blankets, but do get softer with washing.  So, if you are buying these before your little one arrives, I recommend washing them a few times to get them softer!",
            "I got this Christmas present for my sister before my nephew was delivered.  He was born on Jan. 14th of this year and he's been using it every night.  Each time he takes a shower, we would give him a new blanket.  This swaddle blanket isn't thick which is good.  After the bath, we would give him a new fresh of clothes to put on such as mitts (so he won't scratch his face) and socks.  After that, we wrap him in this thin swaddle blanket and especially for the first two weeks, his arms had to be down beside his body because when he sleeps with his arms up, he gets shaken up like he was falling in his sleep.  And after the swaddle blanket, we put a thick baby blanket on him for him to sleep so he can stay warm.  This product is good too where after he showers, you can use the swaddle old blanket as a towel to dry him.  I recommend this product and if she needs another set, I'd purchase it again.",
            "I bought these swaddles as well as a set of Aden and Anais swaddle blankets. I loved the price and figured after reading other reviews they were comparable to the ever raved about Aden and Anais blankets. Since getting these swaddle blankets I have been pretty disappointed.After washing them in dreft baby detergent and drying on medium heat the fabric has bunched up and gotten really scratchy. They have shrunk so much that the original design is indistinguishable. I can no longer use these as swaddles because they have lost their ability to stretch and I can't create a tight swaddle.I still gave these 3 stars instead of 1 because I have gotten a lot of use out of them as burp clothes and rags. I would not recommend these to someone for the use as a swaddle blanket.If you are looking for a good quality swaddle blanket go with Aden and Anais!",
            "My daughter LOVES these blankets.  They are thin enough that I don't worry when she falls asleep with them, yet can be folded over to keep her warm if need be.  They wash great and have become even better with wear.  They are not the absolute softest blankets in the world, but they are soft enough for my 4 month old to want to cuddle up to.  The pink is beautiful, however the sheep pattern on the other blanket is a bit light.  It would be hard to tell what it was if you didn't already know.  I would purchase these again, great value for the price!",
            "I've used these every.day. for the last 9 months with my daughter!!  They are my absolute favorite! When she was a newborn, they were a little large, so I folded them in half and then swaddled her up in them, but I honestly liked that because she was born in the fall and could use an extra layer.  They are the perfect weight and so soft!  They are really breathable too, because I've never had a problem with her getting too hold or cold in them.  I STILL swaddle my baby up for naps/night (she's 9 months), and these blankets have the perfect amount of stretch and movement that she can feel snuggled, but can also move her hands under hands and arms. (You can easily do a tighter swaddle to \"lock them in\" as well!)  The color faded a bit, but that was a small price to pay for the size, softness, and durability.Update 11/17/18: We have rotated both of these blankets daily for 2 years, and they are still in fantastic shape! Very little fading, super soft, no rips or tears... and we have not been gentle with them!",
            "I bought these swaddle blankets when my baby was just born and they are still going (baby is 19 months now). Initially I used them to swaddle the baby and as a burp cloth (my baby had bad reflux). As the baby got older, I used them as a blanket for her while she took a nap in the stroller. I would also clip them to the canopy of the stroller so the sun wouldn't go in her eyes while she took a nap.The fabric is soft, breathable, lightweight and washes well. After, 18 months of regular use the sheep print has faded but the fabric is still fine. Relative to the other swaddle blankets I had, these are much larger.Also, these are nicely packed and would make a cute and practical gift.",
            "I have probably 20 of these types of blankets between my 2 year old son and infant daughter.  My favorite are the Hudson Baby decorative style blankets.  (In this item that would be the leaf designed blanket as compared to the solid colored dark blue blanket.)The Hudson Baby decorative blanket is my favorite because: 1) great price, 2) large sized, 3) super soft, and 4) cute design.This item only received 4 stars because...1) The solid colored style in this set seems to get white fuzzes on it if I wash the blanket with the wrong things - like towels.  That happens with two kids under 2 though!and 2) I wish they sold the blankets individually so I could pick the solid colors at will.  Since they are sets I have ended up with multiple light pink, dark pink, light blue and dark blue blankets from the 2-Packs.",
            "These are a little smaller in size than the Aidan and anais brand, but are still quite large for a baby blanket. They are perfect for swaddling little babies or for toddlers to snuggle. I love the print on these in particular. I bought it for the foxes but now that I have them I find that I like the arrows the very best. I use them along with my other Muslin blankets almost exclusively. If you don't already have Muslin blankets and you are expecting or have a small baby then please buy these or one similar for your little one. You'll be so glad you did. They are light weight, soft and absorbent. My favorite...and I'm a mother of 5, I've tried a lot.",
            "I really wanted to like these. The alternative Muslim swaddling blankets are quite pricey and the reviews were so good. However, I own a SwaddleDesign and an Aden and Anais classic swaddle blanket and there really is no comparison.  These blankets are too puffy; yes they're thin but the weave makes it much thicker to work with. Baby doesn't look comfortable at all after I swaddle unlike using the other swaddle blanket. When I wrap my baby using HB, then the other blankets I own, there is a VERY noticeable difference in her size. She is literally higher off the crib mattress. I don't think the material is as breathable.If you're not sure which one to get, I would recommend you get the SwaddleDesign or A&amp;A. Instead of buying multiples of the HB, get the quality brand because you might need fewer. Due to the quality and thinness, I find them easier to wash. I even handwash my SD blanket and hung dry; it was fine to use again by nighttime."

I have a bit of junk in my trunk and this top glides over it nicely :)  It\u2019s very flattering and perfect for wine tasting w the girls! You can dress it up or wear it super casual.

This top is a hit!!!  True to size, super comfortable and gave me increased confidence as I literally have no butt, but this top made my waist look small and gave me the bump back there I needed :-)  Get you one of these for the price!!",

The cut of the shirt is really boxie so it doesn't look good on girls that are short and chuncky. I'm 5'2 196lbs evenly distributed. I wear a size 12/14. I followed the size chart and other reviews to a T and it was really big on me. i should have sized down not up. I'm not sure if I even want to try to order another one.",

I probably could have ordered a small and still been comfortable, but I liked being able to knot it as pictured by the seller.  Overall I\u2019m Willie happy with this purchase.",
            "Super cute lightweight shirt. I sized up one size and it fits great, slightly loose as I had hoped. I'm sure my normal size would have fit, but I think it would have been a little clingy on my \"curves\". Decal is slightly sticky so use caution when laundering. It's very soft and thin,  but not see through. For reference, I am 5'5\", 165 lbs, 38D. Usually wear a large and ordered XL. I love it!",

I\u2019m 5\u20193 &amp; 140lbs &amp; got a size L &amp; it\u2019s not too big, not too small. It also came with a cute beaded necklace so that was a nice surprise &amp; it looks cute with the shirt.",

I was sceptical at first because the largest size was a 2x and I wear between a 2 and 3x depending on how it's made, but this shirt fit so well. It's super cute too. I couldn't wait to put it on. It is also a light weight shirt and with this Arkansas heat that helps. Regular t-shirts are usually too hot to wear right now. And I love Willie!!",
            "Overall fit of the shirt was great, the material is soft, however the design was printed directly on it so it\u2019s stiff. I\u2019m going to have to hand wash it if I don\u2019t want the vinyl to peel off",
            "I love it! I weigh about 155 pounds and I like tops loose so I ordered an XL. If I ordered again I would probably get a large. I loved how comfy it is though! The shirt material is thin but soft, and stretchy. With the way the design is printed, I'm worried about it not holding up in the washer but for now it's great. The company also sent me a little surprise, which was so cute!!",
            "I love the print on this shirt! Very sticky when I opened it though so be careful washing it. It does not fit as expected. I usually wear an XL so I sized up because I wanted it baggy enough to tie. It is not. It's fits, but a lot smaller than a typical XXL even for the Chinese stuff. So I can't tie it like I had hoped. The description shows it's a cotton blend. I'm going to say there is very little cotton in this, but super soft material. I like it. Just be aware if you're allergic to any fabrics. Over all, I really like this shirt. I just wish it had been more true to size.",

It is very soft but does not have a t- shirt fit at all !  It is also suppose to be an XL but it fit like a medium, it is super stretchy so I could wear it like a fitted shirt but the quality is just not there.  I returned this product the next day after receiving it.  I should have known something was up when the first thing it said on the note that came with it was, \" Thank you very much for your trust and support on us, we will do our best to deliver better products in future.\"  And no I did not mess up, that is how it read , it got worse as the note went on.

The sizing is very accurate also. I ordered an XXL to be safe because everything seems to run so small. It\u2019s exactky the size an XXL should be. Good price too. I got it just in time for Memorial Day. Love it!",

I guess I should have ordered a size up, but then the arm holes would have been too big as they are already a bit big on my arms. I'd say this 'shape' is a bit disproportionate for a female figure. Also, it's a bit hot with the collar high up on the neck, not ideal for a hot July 4th outside.",

            "I like it! I wanted an Americana style shirt for the 4th of July and am so glad I started with this one. It\u2019s perfect and a great value! The print, the fit, it\u2019s all awesome. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d 150 pounds, pretty top heavy (broad shoulders, long torso and my mommy pooch gives me a larger waist; but my hips are smaller and I\u2019ve got very thin legs), and usually in either a Med or Large in tops. Bought this in Large and the fit is perfect! Nice and loose in the cutest way, not at all too baggy, and super flattering \u2014 and I always worry with tank tops as it\u2019s very hit or miss with me and my shoulders but this one is just so perfect. And it\u2019s so soft I don\u2019t want to take it off! I might wear it to bed haha. I probably could\u2019ve worn a medium fine too but I\u2019m glad I got my larger size as the fit is brilliant and I wouldn\u2019t want to change it! I 10000% recommend this top! I\u2019d say to stick TTS unless you\u2019re between two sizes than pick your larger one if possible. But luckily I think this top is so flattering that most could easily pull off two different sizes in it so my best advice is don\u2019t fret too much about size! It\u2019s a great top, if you like it do yourself a huge favor and just go for it! You\u2019ll be glad you did :)Ps Attaching pictures but it\u2019s even cuter than my pictures show! It really looks and fits just like the seller shows on the model. You\u2019ll love it!",
            "I bought this top as 4th of July was approaching &amp; I wanted something that looked good &amp; was different from what anyone else might have. This top did not disappoint as I received many compliments on it. I usually wear a small, but after looking at the size charts I ordered a small. Fits perfect.",
            "I overall was very happy with this product! Im a large/medium and im also 7 months pregnant so i went with a large. Was roomy for my baby belly and fit very comfortably! The material was light but durable. Perfect for summer!",

            "Shoulders are too boxy and unflattering, can\u2019t really see it in the photo but it looks very ill fitting in real life. Fabric isn\u2019t cotton nor does it have a relaxed fit. It\u2019s the type of top that doesn\u2019t absorb your sweat and so it just kind of sits there, kind of like an unabsorbent kitchen towel. Length is just right and falls to my navel. However, it feels slightly tight? Like the shoulders were sewn on too close to the body. Tried to fold the sleeves to give it some dimension but it still didnt do anything. Quality wise, this top feels like it really costs $3. Not something I recommend or would buy again. I\u2019m 4\u201911, 32A, 24-25\u201d waistline. Looks better on taller people who arent flat chested like I am",

            "This looks like it would be a cotton top, and the tag inside says its 100% cotton. But, it definitely is not cotton. It's like some sort of plastic/stretch/idk what. If it were cotton, I'd like it a lot more. But it came really quickly! It is also kinda short and wide. (I'm about 5f 6i and 135# and got the pink in Medium.) Not terrible for the price I guess.",

But then I washed it and the collar stretched out super weirdly. Or it's just shaper strange. I woukd suggest going with the Bella cropped white tee or any color they have - it's super soft and the same price. Just get a size smaller than usual because it's baggy.",

Have not worn it out or sweated in it so not sure how fabric will feel on skin in the Texas heat, or at the gym.",

Have not worn or washed it but I expect it will be fine."

The shirt is super breathable, the stains can be simply wiped off with a damp cloth and it dries immediately. It also protects somewhat from the wind. I am size 8 and 5'7\" and the medium was somewhat large on me. I think I should have gone a smaller size.",

I usually buy a medium and this shirt in medium fits me not too tight and not too baggy.  To go braless, I would suggest buying one size larger than normal.  Will purchase more of these; would be nice if they offered earth colors like pale olive and pale rust; dark colors just seem to soak up the sun.  If you are looking for this NYLON shirt, be careful not to confuse it with the other Columbia Bahama shirts made of polyester knit or cotton, etc.  My review refers only to this nylon version. Thanks Amazon",

They are made of pretty thin (but nice) fabric that is breathable so you stay cool. They are not meant to be fitted so they may seem to run a little big if you aren't used to wearing fishing shirts. I wear a small in most shirts and also wear a small in these.",
            "Was true to size for me (but remember these are fishing type shirts so they are not going to form fit and go with your skinny jeans). Liked the long tails on them that made them easy to keep tucked in when working in a warehouse. Other than the color look very professional. Back venting is AMAZING in a hot warehouse. Biggest perk though is you can pull them out of the drier wrinkled as heck and one night hanging in the bathroom while your husband takes a hot shower will cause all the wrinkles to drop out. Thank you Columbia for freeing me from ironing! :)",
            "I love Columbia products! I did order this a size too big (my own fault), but it's still quite comfortable. It's great on a warmer day as it will wick some of the moisture away from your skin. It's light and is perfect for active living. I have a blue one a size smaller and it fits perfectly-just enough wiggle room. I just wear a tank under the pink one and leave it unbuttoned.",

It's well constructed and feels very comfortable.  I took off one star because the color is not exactly as shown on the website.  The color on the photo appears muted but in reality, it's more neon color -- not exactly my favorite.  I'm keeping it to wear on hot and humid summer days.",

It looks very nice on me. The material feels soft to the touch. It is really a cute shirt. Love the color. It goes with everything. When I first put it on, I just smiled. It feels and looks wonderful. And it fits so nicely. You can be really active in it, but it looks tailored. Would highly recommend it to anyone!"

They fit very well and are nice and stretchy. The material is soft and these could even be worn as non-workout tanks. I gave these 4 stars only because I sweat through them pretty easily.

But being in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, having gained 25 pounds, I went with the large. I plan to wear these to the gym for the last 8 weeks of pregnancy.

It's not as long as I usually prefer however it's tight without being so tight that the shirt flips up so I don't mind it falling just below my hips.  For a bustier gal this might be a bit too tight but smaller busts can get away with using it as a loose sports bra - but beware the headlights can still be seen as it's not a double layer. Would definitely repurchase.",
            "These tank tops are great. I wear them with leggings and they are long enough to cover my booty. You have to be careful when you wash them but they're great if you care for them. They're perfect, thin enough to feel like nothing yet thick enough to feel like you aren't naked. Highly recommend."

            "I absolutely love this shirt !it came as described,goes off shoulder perfect fit, although it is true to size,so if you want a more loose fit order a size up ,I'm usually a small ordered a medium and it fits perfect just a little more roomy .",
            "This shirt did not come with the quarter sleeve as pictured. Shirt is fitting...should order up a size. Cute shirt, just didn\u2019t come as expected",
            "I really loved this shirt! The quality is really good and does not feel cheap at all. It fit well, and i got alot of compliments on it. I would definitely recommend this shirt!",
            "I like it. I had to go up a size. Sent the medium back because it was way too tight on my chest (34D). The large fit much better",
            "I ordered a size up based on reviews Should have ordered my normal size but it still works I tied it to the side bc it's pretty long I'm 5'4. The shirt works off the shoulders or to the side which is something I was looking for.",
            "Cute shirt! I normally wear an XL but bought an XXL for a looser fit. It's not loose but fits well.",
            "Great looking and comfortable shirt. It washes well. I received a few compliments on it.",
            "Super cute and sexy...wont be wearing it just at holidays!!! Love me some America."

            "This is a nice top, I recently had a baby and needed something that wasn\u2019t hugging the few extra pounds that i have right now. I also like my shirts a little longer because I live my life in leggings right now. This is perfect. Cute enough to dress up for work or dress down to go to the park with the kids. It\u2019s a nice white and very soft.",
            "This tops is pure perfection and may be one of my absolute favorite clothing purchases on Amazon. I ordered a Medium in the long sleeve shirt. The length is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It falls about an inch below my butt in the back and it\u2019s slightly shorter in the front. The fabric is incredibly soft and almost has a slightly silky feel to it. It\u2019s light weight and airy, yet not see through.The Lace detail on the bottom is absolutely beautiful and feels durable so I\u2019m not worried about it falling apart which is a huge relief. I love that this has the feel of a comfy tee, but the detail on the bottom allows you to dress it up. You could pair this with jeans for a casual look or dress pants and heels to dress it up for work. I highly recommend this top.",
            "Cute comfy top, perfect sleeve length for spring, I love simple tops with just a little flair for an easy outfit. Happy with the price! Fits well.",
            "I chose this blouse to go along with my many fun skirts and leggings that are basically blue but have a lot of other color. I wanted something to drape nicely and be fun. This is a beautiful blouse. it fits well and the color is intense. I hope it lasts a long time, because it's already a favorite!",
            "The fabric feels like a soft cotton.  Nice length for me (I'm 5'8.5\") and it's long enough in the front that it will hide a bit of tummy and the back is a bit longer but not way over the butt.  I think this will be a good all purpose top for wearing over leggings. Happy with my purchase and after I wear it a few times I might order other colors.",
            "Love this top! The fabric is nice, great quality for the price! Perfect top for Spring and Summer!I have purchased a second in another color!",
            "This is a beautiful top,  well made and fits exactly as expected.  True to size,  would recommend.",
            "I bought this for my mom, it's good shirt for spring and the material it's very soft, recommended",
            "This top is something you can wear to work or you can wear on a day just to hang out. The shirt is true to size so get your normal size. The fabric is not heavy. The shirt has a lot of stretch. All in a decent shirt.",
            "Very pleased with purchase. Great quality.....will probably hand wash to keep color and material like new. I\u2019m hard to please on purchasing clothes online but this was spot on. Will purchase from this company again."

            "Arrived on time, packaged nicely and fits great! I ordered a large and I am 5.3/135 pounds/36DDD. Very soft material and is long enough to cover my butt. Haven\u2019t washed it yet...don\u2019t think I will dry it fully...might dry for a few then let air dry as I don\u2019t want it to shrink. I am impressed and plan to order a few more in different colors. Great price also!",
            "This shirt is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! I bought it for an 80's themed party, and not only is it perfect for it, it's totally OK to wear normally, too. As other reviewers said, the material is super soft. I am about 5'6 and range from 150-160 lbs. And the large fit me, perfectly. I wanted baggy. And it is baggy, but not overly baggy. Enough to pull the side down, on the shoulder. I can even knot it on the side and it's still baggy. A medium would have fit me, perfectly, but the look I was going for, needed baggy. This shirt is just so cute and you couldn't beat the price for $14. AND it came nicely folded in a heavier zip block bag. Which sounds silly, but it's nice it wasn't just thrown in an envelope.",
            "So this is nice enough...I guess.  Thez material is awfully thin.  If you want it to fit like the girl pictured, order up 2 sizes. I typically wear a large, I ordered an XL,  it fits but again, not as nice as the model.",
            "Great top! I\u2019m 5\u20196 and if worn off the shoulders some it covered my butt nicely. Lots of compliments on my entire outfit! If there was a size I\u2019m sure I bought a small.",
            "Totally love this shirt.  The quality is good, but the sizing is WAY off.  I went with other's reviews and sized up.  I normally wear a large, but sized up to the 2X and it fits great.  If you're looking for a tighter fit, go with one size up, but if you're looking for a little looser fit, I'd go up two sizes.  It's not super baggy, but just a comfortable loose fit.  Otherwise, great material for the price and the print is good.",
            "It was perfect for what it was used for! 80's night fundraiser was a blast!",
            "Soft and comfy. Fit as expected. Really cute!! Only thing is I thought it could be a little longer and I don\u2019t have a long torso for those who do it will be shorter then excepted in my opinion. Otherwise I love it!!",
            "Omg\ud83d\ude0d This is just awesome! I got the xxl. I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d and 180 lbs for reference! So soft and perfect style! I could give it 10 stars!",
            "The sleeves are not as pictured, they\u2019re fitted in the arms. The picture is misleading. I usually wear a small/medium in shirts. I ordered the large for the oversized off the shoulder look. It\u2019s ok, but I am disappointed by the sleeves. If I can find a better shirt before my event, I\u2019ll probably return it.",
            "Okay so I love this shirt.  I was skeptic at first but I read the reviews and just thought to myself that it is cheap so if I get it and don't like it then at least I didn't spend a lot of money on it or I could give away as a gift.  When I received it I was super surprised.  The material is amazing.  It is so soft and just feels perfect on my skin.  I do wish it came off the shoulder in a more baggy way but that Is just because I bought it to where it was the perfect fit I believe next time I will get a size bigger so that I can have one to laze around in and etc.  However, the size I got was perfect and I love it a lot.  It makes me feel so good about myself.  it shows off just the right amount of curves.  It is definitely worth the cost I paid. I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was.  I will definitely buy more clothes like these from here hehe."

            "I\u2019m surprised by the bad reviews yeah the fringe was a little clingy but honestly not that big of deal. I wore it to boots in the park and it was just fine. Ordering a second in Black for Stagecoach.",
            "Great for hippie costume",
            "I absolutely loved this vest! It was cute, comfy, and good quality!I wore it to outside lands music festival in San Francisco and it looked adorable with my outfit! I will definitely be wearing it again soon!I am 5'6 and about 160 pounds and the Medium fit perfect.",
            "It was Everything that I expected! It was. Tiny bit snug, but I am a plus size woman! Other than that I was very pleased! Everyone loved it! Got so many compliments",
            "Beautiful, I love the quality, light . and I really like the knot it has. ^_^ \ud83d\udc95",
            "A great little vest for the money.  I wore it to a Woodstock party and got loads of compliments.  It does run true to size.  I had ordered an extra large, assuming it would run small, when I usually wear a large.  The large would have been a better fit but it still worked.  Light weight!",
            "Very nice. A perfect piece to add to your hippy look. Looked awesome on for a 60\u2019s /70s party!I\u2019m 5\u20198 and these were very very long on me...other than that, nice fabric very comfortable.",
            "I was pleased with the vest. I bought it to replace the vest to a hippy costume and it works great. So much better quality than the one than came with my costume.  It is soft, not a heavy weight fabric, flows well, and I like the long fringe. The lacing along the edges in front is stylish.  It doesn't have to be worn as a costume but it's not really heavy duty enough to be worn a lot.",
            "this is a really cute piece and honestly, nice enough to wear as a regular piece of clothing not just for costumes.  It is very lightweight but feels well constructed and the fringe is all secure.  The fabric feels like light suede.  I don't know how it will hold up over time but for the occasional times I'll use it, I'm thrilled with the style and price.",
            "I bought this vest for attending a rodeo and it was perfect!  The only slightly negative feedback (and why I didn't give 5 stars) I have is that the fringes can get pretty tangled, however, can easily be undone by running your fingers through the tassels.  Overall very satisfied for the cost, would buy again!"
