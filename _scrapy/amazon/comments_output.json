I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked as well.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer. Also, I think that the Gilden shrank significantly in the first wash. The shrinkage seemed to be in t in the shoulders and in the length. I would say that the T-shirt went from a large to a medium. It still fits but I had wanted a large T-shirt, not a medium.  I washed the T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.", "My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.", "I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.", "Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.A great find!", "These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.", "These are my husband's favorite shirts, they are thick and durable. We will be buying more.", "Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like. I am a throw it in the laundry and go type so I needed bigger so I could shrink it. I am 250 lbs and 5'11 with a beer gut. I got the 2x and it fit just a touch too big and after 1 wash it is perfect. After a few more washes I might have wished on a 3x but not sure yet. As of now they are perfect and am happy. Only thing that will change when I order more is color and  possible size upgrade if it continues to shrink.", "Size was correct. Shirt is soft and comfortable as you would expect of cotton. I will be buying more of these.", "Very disappointed with these T's. After the first washing the bottom hems unraveled. Also the material is super scratchy. They are pretty much useless to wear un-tucked due to the unraveled hems.I have purchased much less costly white T-shirts from Gildan and was quite pleased with them. Would be curious to know if anybody else has had the same situation.", "They use the words \"Soft premium cotton\", but I don't think Gildan knows what soft is.  I've ordered many different brands of T-Shirts in my quest to find a favorite.  These are by far the roughest feeling yet(before and after wash/dry).  These will either end up being cut into rags or in the clothes donation bin."]},
{"asin": "B00VZYXF8Y", "comments": ["I used to find these Beefy- tees in Walmart years ago. My husband needs the 2x. Then they stopped carrying them. One day, when my brain was working, I decided to peruse through Amazon. I couldn't believe my luck, when I found the Hanes Beefy tees. So I ordered 12. But you have to know: The ones I purchased at Wal-Mart 10 years ago, are still holding up, (barely). If you are married to a larger size man, or if YOU happen to be one, these are THE best quality t-shirts you'll ever find, or wear. They stand up to hundreds of washings, and the color seletion is superb. But the most important thing to us, is that they are 100% cotten. Best quality for your money.", "NOT TAGLESS. Pretty sure I got a knock off,  it has 2 cheap big tags. It is not \"beefy\" it is thin. Every other Hanes Beefy Tee(at least 5) I have bought are tagless with thick cotton. Will never buy from this seller again...\"Clothing Shop Online\"", "This shirt is very well made with a thick weave.  The color matches the picture even after repeated washings and there is no noticeable shrinkage even after tumble-drying on my dryer's highest setting.  I also tried applying iron-on transfers made for dark t-shirts to one of them and it worked beautifully.  I would recommend washing the shirt first, however, before trying to apply any iron-on transfer.", "I ordered a medium, which according to Haynes is for chests 38-40. My chest is exactly 40. When I tried the shirt on it was skin tight; so tight that I actually had some problems peeling it off. I then measured the shirt front just below the armpits and it was 19\" wide; times two is 38\". This explains why it was so tight for a 40 chest. As far as \"beefy\" was concerned, my opinion is that it's not. It's not thin, but neither is it heavy. Hanes used to sell a true \"beefy\" T, which I wore for probably 10 years, but a few years ago they cheapened the product.I had also been considering buying similar shirts from LL Bean or Land's End, but those cost 3 times as much; around $18 each, I decided to return the Hanes shirts and see what the much higher price of a LL Bean shirt would get me. When the shirts arrived I did some comparisons. The LL Bean shirt chest front measured 22\" (compared to 19\" for the Hanes) and it weighed 7.6  oz compared to 6.5 oz for the Haines; i.e. the LL Bean shirt was beefier than the Hanes, even though it was described as standard weight.Is it worth 3 times the price? Probably not. Just order one size up, don't expect a heavy weight shirt, and you'll probably be happy and definitely richer.", "I don\u2019t know why I just don\u2019t understand that you get what you pay for.I bought two of these, one Royal Blue and one Black.After washing and drying on a low setting, the overall shrinkage was minimal but as I suspected might happen, the bottom of the shirt folds up below the bottom seam. It is almost impossible to get it to fold back. Spraying a mist of water and adding a few clothes pins helps but that\u2019s just ridiculous.In addition to that, the seams where the sleeves are sewn to the body of the shirt are all puckered. It\u2019s impossible to flatten them, even ironing them.They are just plain old garbage and I should have paid double for one shirt...at least I would have had a wearable shirt instead of none.", "Junk!  These used to be like G.I. issue shirts long ago.  Now they include stretched out neck bands which get larger when washed!  I'm sorry I bought them, typical Asia made shirts with poor quality.  Seams were not uniform as well.  I've heard that the Costco shirts may be better.  Amazon did have a good price on these shirts, but I'm sorry that I purchased them.", "This is not \"beefy\" at all! I have a few Hanes Beefy T-shirts from a couple of years back and those are of the real quality: 100% cotton, no BS.The new t-shirt is 90% cotton + 10% polyester: you can see the daylight through the fabric. I's expect these to go through 4-5 wash cycles and become a rag. For the $6 it doesn't worth the trouble of returning it. But be aware.", "I keep coming back to buy more of these.  These are great work shirts and just general usage shirts and the only decent t-shirt with a pocket anymore.* Durability for cheap.  For $7 a shirt you get a fairly beefy cotton that doesn't rip the instant it catches on anything.  It holds up well in the wash.  The dye doesn't seem to fade.  I can't tell the difference between two year old and two month old shirts.* Pocket is nice.  It's big enough to stuff your phone into it, but its better suited to light items that won't fall out due to gravity if you bend forward and stuff that you can clip to the edge of the pocket.  Business cards, paper notes, pens, and small flashlights with pocket clips all do well in the pocket.  If you put a phone in it expect it to flop out on the concrete if you bend forward more than 45 degrees.* Consistency.  I've bought 8 of these so far, two at a time over the course of about two years as I replaced my other work t-shirts.  The sizing has not been altered in that time, nor has the material weight.  I can't even tell the difference between the shirts from two years ago and the most recent ones, they don't even seem to have worn.* Modest cut.  They lean toward the boxy side which is fine if you aren't trying to show off.  If you're a little on the pudgy side it's actually preferable.  When I first got these I was about 195 at 6'1\", two years later I've slimmed down while hitting the weights and sitting at 175 with a little more muscle in my upper torso and considerably less fat around my waist.  If you want to turn any heads or catch any eyes this is not your go to t-shirt.", "A few months ago I ordered a sample of these tshirts. They fit perfect and were nice and beefy. However after I reordered this time with the same seller, these tshirts were not the same. They were a lot thinner material and they did not have the tagless style. It seems like Hanes sold out just like the Rast of the t-shirt companies and opted for cheaper thin stretchy material. Very disappointing, since this was the last resort for thicker tshirts. They'll say it was the same thickness bit standards have definitely changed. I have the comparisons right here In front of me. I hate wasting money buying cloths online when they keep getting cheaper with quality.", "I think this is a knock off.  The shirt has tags and shrunk considerably in the first wash.  This is not a Hanes Beefy Tee quality shirt.  Must be a fake."]},
{"asin": "B07GKRLCLC", "comments": ["I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.", "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.", "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(", "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.", "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.", "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.", "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.", "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad", "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.", "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"]},

{"asin": "B07F1D55LM", "comments": ["I ordered a two-pack of these Slim Fit t-shirts and a two-pack of the Regular Fit t-shirts to compare and contrast. Both styles are made of the same thick cotton knit fabric, which is soft and substantial, but the fits are definitely different. These Slim Fit shirts are significantly tighter fitting in the stomach, arms, and chest area(s). The Regular Fit shirts are much looser in all three of these areas, especially the arms.Compared to a Regular Fit I would categorize these as a Slim Fit not, a Snug Fit; they fit close to the body but not tightly enough to show something like muscle definition, if that's what you're looking for.For comparison, I would say that these  Amazon Essentials Slim Fit t-shirts are tighter fitting than a standard Gap or Old Navy t-shirt fit but looser fitting than a standard American Apparel or H&amp;M t-shirt fit.Overall the quality is nice, with minimal fading and only very minor shrinkage after laundering in cold water and putting in a medium dryer. Recommended if you like a close fitting, thick cotton t-shirt.", "I bought both medium and large to check for best fit. Before washing, medium fit the best and large was a bit too big. After washing, the medium becomes too small and the large fits better.", "As someone who's pushing 6'3\" and 175lbs (most of that being around the mid-region), I was really debating between getting this shirt in large or the regular/loose fit in a medium. So I got both! And if I'm being honest, there wasn't very much of a difference. While this shirt in a medium (which I also bought) did feel tight, the large met with my broad shoulders perfectly and didn't get too slim as it went down along my chest and stomach (though the advertising photo makes it look like it totally just becomes a \"V\" towards the crotch). The regular-fit medium had a very similar fit, but was about a half inch shorter in vertical length and an inch shorter across the shoulders. Though it didn't slim as it went down like the slim-fit large, it's already shorter width made it feel like a tighter fit. Weird, right?? I tried on both shirts again and again, both before and after a single wash/dry, trying to point out all the differences before I came here to write about it here. All in all, I'm probably going to keep the slim-fit large as it actually has the shoulder length I like while not staying that length all the way down and giving off a total box-y fit. The slim-fit medium was just too small and the regular-fit medium was just a little too narrow, though I believe a regular-fit large would probably be too wide. One complaint of all the shirts that I'll have is that after a wash/dry, the hems at the bottom of the shirt did begin to curl up a bit, which is disappointing because it looks cheap (which I know it is, but other people don't). But other than that, I didn't detect any shrinkage and that's a huge plus given the price.", "One of the shirts was just as expected; the other one had two different sleeve sizes. The left sleeve is wayyy smaller than the right (and the other shirts sleeves) to the point that it hugs my arm while the other hangs loose.", "Not sure why these were called slim fit.

It's so small and uncomfortably tight on your neck.  Really the whole shirt fits odd, but the neck is the real problem.  The actual shirt material is fine.  I tossed this shirt pretty early into me having it.Try again Amazon.  Find a better pattern.", "You can't go wrong with these.  The fabric is soft and the sleeves and torso seem to have a little more intentional length added to them--both plusses in my book for a casual t-shirt.  I ordered a medium and, with about a 16.5'' neck, the rim of the collar comes right up to my neckline--fine for me but might perhaps be a potential warning for guys who are a little more husky or athletic.  I personally love them and will be buying again.", "I think if XS had been available it would have fit perfectly but I knew it would be a little large for me so I\u2019m not disappointed. It was precisely the shirt I needed for this cosplay! I\u2019m very picky about getting colors right and this one came the exact color as seen. It\u2019s also nice to get two in case one gets a stain while at convention! It\u2019s a very comfortable shirt and doesn\u2019t hug my chest. Tucking the front in my belt provided the exact look I was trying to duplicate. It\u2019s a great product! And I\u2019ll definitely wear these beyond cosplay!"]},

{"asin": "B00Z7STGFA", "comments": ["I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.", "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.", "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(", "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.", "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.", "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.", "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.", "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad", "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.", "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"]},

Say your phone skated in slo-mo into the gap in between the seats and walkway. Say you watched it careen the 15 feet or so to the ground below, into the dirt, under the bleachers. Say you looked at her and you knew she knew and she didn\u2019t even say sorry. Say you found a custodial guy eating a burger with a *LOT* of mustard. Say you complimented him on his hunk of keys and told him the tale. Say he unlocked a creepy gate under the bleachers and found your phone in THIS OTTERBOX and it was perfectly fine. This is what happened to me. Wish it were cuter? Say you put on a jungle PopSocket with pink flamingoes. I will NEVER get another case. Only me and the OTTERBOX.", "\u00a0I purchased this case for an iPhone 8 Plus. The first case Amazon sent lifts in the center causing a gap between the screen and the phone. I called OtterBox and filed a complaint. They said exchange the case with Amazon cause it's been less than 30 days. Amazon quickly sent me a second case. The second case had the exact same problem suggesting the new iPhone 8 Plus Defender Case may have quality control problems. Take a look at the photo I included with this review. The point where the plastic is connected to the case is lower on the bottom and the top then it is in the middle. The video shows the same anomaly - pressing on the screen causes the case to bend resulting in missed keypresses and harder contact. I am a huge fan of OtterBox Defender cases and my previous iPhone 6 case does NOT have this defect.UPDATED 9/26/17 - Per OtterBox's response to my review, I called Customer Service for a replacement case. A representative named Ariel took my call, looked up my incident number, and offered to help. I explained the issue with the case and OtterBox's response to my review. Ariel apologized for the defect and placed me on hold to speak with a Supervisor. Upon return, Ariel offered to complete a Warranty exchange for a new case to be sent out. I said that sounds good until Ariel asked me to pay $4.99 for Shipping and Handling. I said, let me get this straight, I ordered a new case through Amazon and it arrived defective. I replaced the case through Amazon and the second one is also defective. OtterBox invited me to call Customer Service for a replacement case and now I need to pay an additional $4.99 to have a working case sent to me by OtterBox. Clearly, OtterBox has given up on Quality Control AND on Customer Service.DO NOT BUY THIS CASE UNTIL OTTERBOX PROVIDES A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE!!!!UPDATED 10/5/17 - The replacement case finally arrived via FedEx SmartPost. The screen protector is perfectly attached to the side of the shell and there doesn't appear to be any gap between the screen and the phone. This suggests the first release of iPhone 8+ cases likely had a manufacturing defect which was corrected in stock sent to OtterBox. Check your case for screen protector alignment issues before the Amazon return policy expires and if you do need to go through OtterBox for a warranty exchange, expect to pay for shipping and handling.", "If you want ultimate protection, this is the case for you. But if want a case to show how slim your new iPhone is, look elsewhere. To give you an idea on the thickness, on the back around the Apple logo and camera is about a quarter inch of protection. Again, great case, small hands beware.", "I\u2019ve used OtterBox in the past and sometimes felt it was beyond the protection I needed.  The cases have always been made sturdy, easy to put together, and built to last.  The OtterBox remains one of the leading brands for phone case protection and I feel the brand continues to improve the case design that aligns with phone innovations.Usually, I don\u2019t gravitate towards colorful cases but the rosemarine/plum haze color is fun and not overbearing.  I also enjoy the color combination with my rose gold iPhone 7 Plus and feel that it compliments it.  The case comes in 3 pieces and is easy to put together.  The inner layer consists of two hard plastic pieces that snap around the case, one side includes the screen protector.  The outer shell is a rubbery flexible material that covers the area where the inner pieces connect and add extra protection.I\u2019m very impressed with the screen protection with this Otterbox.  In my opinion, the screen protector feels better than using the solo film screen protectors.  Not better than glass, but I have the luck of breaking glass ones after a couple of days.  The screen protector also doesn\u2019t have the annoying bubbles and doesn\u2019t cling to a speck of dust.  The only parts of the phone that are consistently exposed are the speakers and the cameras.  The buttons are covered and are fully functional without difficulty.  The lightning port and the switch to set your iPhone 7 Plus to silent are covered with the rubber but you can open them.The only downfall I used to have with the Otterbox was the size.  Now that the iPhone 7 Plus is much slimmer I feel the case is a better fit.  I can\u2019t use the Otterbox with my lightning dock but not many cases on my phone allow me to use it anyway.Overall, the Otterbox Defender for the iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent choice for people with an active lifestyle or professions that put your phone at risk for damage.  The Otterbox is one of those cases that if I were to drop my phone I wouldn\u2019t gasp and cringe in fear because I know it\u2019s thoroughly protected.", "I had just bought a new iPhone 7 Plus and I wanted a good case for protective purposes. In the past there had always been occasions when somehow, no matter how careful I was, I managed to drop my cellular phones. In addition, not only did I drop it, but I somehow always managed to drop it onto either a concrete or asphalt surface. At least 2 cell phones I had broken that way, so I was looking for a case that featured \"protection\" as the primary functionality feature of the case I bought. This time, I decided I was not going to make the same mistake again. Thus, I did a search for highly protective iPhone 7 plus compatible cases.Amazon has a huge collection of cases, even ones that are protective. Some even use special military grade plastics. Yet I wanted one that would allow easy access to all the features of my cell phone. This one achieves those objectives, without creating any barriers to access of all my new phone's features. Thus, I chose this one which did everything on my list of requirements.The best results and comments I can make about this \"Otterbox Defender Series Case\" is the following:  1). Installation is trivial and simple  2). Access to every feature and button is easy  3)  AND, the case is very PROTECTIVE!!!How do I know? Because within 48 hours of my installation I was getting out of my car, when I dropped it on the cement parking lot. So, I said to myself, \"Well, that is why I bought this one, so let's see if it is still working.And, Voila, every single function and button still worked. Nothing was damaged, and it greeted me immediately with perfect functionality! In addition, since that time I have dropped the phone 3 more times. Once on my hardwood floor, once on my asphalt parking lot driveway and once again on the concrete slab of my garage and every time it worked perfectly.Note please that all the drops were from an altitude of approximately waist high, therefore about 3 to 4 feet from impact. I decided that in every respect, this Otterbox Defender Series case was a perfect selection for meeting all my criteria. However, I would not attempt to find the limits of its protection. Thus, I do not recommend high altitude drops or throwing the phone and case to the concrete, but for normal use, including accidental drops this product fits the bill in every respect (I did not test for water) and thus I was totally satisfied and gave this product a well earned 5 Star rating. If good accidental drop protection is what you need, then I strongly recommend this product!", "The case goes on and comes off easy, dropped more than once on pavement(butterfingers) phone protected. Only two things I dont like about it are the plastic screen protector that it comes with already attached, terrible, zero protection from anything but dust, Last couple of these for other phones I just took the plastic off and the glue that attaches it and got the glass screen protector that I know offers real protection from minor impacts. The second thing is not a big deal but I figured  I\u2019d mention it, the case does increase the size of the already big phone slightly, the otterbox commuter case is thinner but I like the all rubber exterior of this one over the mostly hard plastic case of the commuter whch I also owned, the all rubber just makes the grip much more secure in your hand. Both cases offer superior protection in my opinion.", "What the hell is the point of getting a NEW defender case when it comes completely smeared?! This will be the second one I\u2019ve purchased the first one was fine this one looks like it fell out at the warehouse and dirty fingerprints are all over it.", "UPDATE- Very disappointed in otter box quality of this case. I may have received a weak and defective product. The white plastic part of the case has snapped inside the soft cover. People use these cases on construction sites with no problems. I go to school, work, and home. There should be no reason why my case has broken after 2 months of me having it. The rest of the case is in perfect condidtion. Also another downside to this open part at the top of the phone is I have to open the case to clean lint and debris from the screen every couple of weeks. That whole also lets water through so if I forget to flip the phone over while I\u2019m at the sink I have to clean water out of the case(which is how I found this break)Very pretty medium dark teal with white shell looks great on my black phone. Fit is sleek at a little under a dimes width for thickness. Durability fantastic obviously otter box is know for being one of the best for protection. The dad clip I\u2019ll admit I use. It helps my small hands hold onto this huge phone kind of like a popsocket would. The clip is also the perfect size to fit in my car door cup holder so I can use my phone for gps. Case does not obstruct the sound quality. Dislikes- although the screen protector does protect my screen from scratches it doesn\u2019t not stop debris from getting in the case. I did not want to have a built in screen protector. I wanted tempered glass but every case with this level of fall protection has a built in protector. I also don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t have the apple logo centered in the circle in the back.I am afraid that this rubber part will start to warp and loosen. Will update with progress of that aspect.", "I have been a otter box fan/ user since they came out, all my cells have had them. I just upgraded my phone and i got my case in the mail. I have never experienced almost having to slam my finger down on my screen to be able to text or unlock it. the screen cover has made it almost impossible to use my phone without slamming the screen. I am so disappointed right now with this case.", "This is a great case, but you have to remove the built-in screen protector. The gap between the protector and your phone\u2019s glass is insane \u2014 you have to press so much harder just to initiate a tap on your phone. AND it\u2019s loud! It sounds like you\u2019re tap dancing when you text someone.Solution: Remove the built-in protector. Grab a knife and start cutting it out, get rid of it, and apply one of those adhesive high-impact glass screen protectors before you put the case on. Much better."]},
{"asin": "B00Z7ST4P2", "comments": ["I love how slim this case is and how well it protects my phone. However, I could not rate this product a \"5\" for two reasons. First, it is not a \"stay-clear/anti-yellowing\" case. After exactly a month of using it (purchase January 7, 2018 and today is February 7, 2018), the front/face of the case has turned yellow. So if you hold the phone case on its side, the front is a yellowish tint and the back is still clear like the day I bought it. I thought it was my make up rubbing off on it, but after cleaning it with soup and water (more than once) it still has a yellowish tint. Also, the back of this case is not a \"hard scratch-resistant shell\". Within my first week of using it I already had numerous scratches. Today, a month later, the back of my case is completely filled with scratches. I will admit, the case does protect my phone. The actually case has cracked but the case is so thick that I can see the crack but I can not feel it and most importantly, my phone is unharmed. By the way, I NEVER write reviews. But I felt the need because I love this case but hate the issues I have encountered within my first month.", "CONFIRMED: This case does work well with the iPhone X and does support QI Charging through the case! It's a snug fit the first time popping the device in, but once it is in it gives great all around protection as expected from OtterBox.My only complaint is that with my Glass Cover which wraps on the sides, the case forces it up and creates a bubble. I will need to try and re-apply the glass with the case on. I would suggest that others do the same.I will also add that the case feels great in my hand with the iPhone X in it, I think this will hold up to anything I throw at it.", "Got this case and put my brand new iPhone in it. I dropped my phone 2ft to the kitchen floor, and it shattered (front and back) into pieces. I even had the Otterbox brand tempered glass on the screen. I have always used the commuter with my previous iPhones and I swear by it. This one is awful, do not trust your $1100 phone in this case. I was stuck making an insurance claim to replace a brand new phone within 2 weeks of buying it and placing it in this case :(", "I don't know about you but the objective of getting a clear case is to show off how elegant the iPhone X really is. My go-to case \"was\" Otterbox because of it's durability. Within a week's time however, the sides started to turn yellow; within 2 weeks even more yellow. So I call the Otterbox customer service to ask if the case is supposed to turn yellow. They say no, so I ask for a replacement. To their credit, they replace it with no problem, albeit, a $6 shipping charge. I get the 2nd one and within the same 2 weeks, it was pretty yellow again. I call Otterbox again and they send me a 3rd one, free of charge this time because I insisted (since they won't admit it turns yellow). Sure enough, after 2 weeks it was yellow again. Folks, it just looks awful with a yellow tint around the sides...it just removes the beauty of the phone. Fortunately, I had known a person who had a Speck Presidio clear case, and theirs had not turned yellow. I finally bought the Speck case in July. We are now in September and it has not turned yellow. Go Speck if you HATE that yellow tint. I'm careful with my phone so I don't usually drop it...I'm not sure is Speck can handle drops better than Otterbox but it sure looks good without that DAMNED yellow tint.", "After a long stay away from this company I decided to give this case a try for my iPhone X.At first glance it\u2019s bulky and rounded, and makes me feel like I\u2019m holding an old Android phone.Incredibly it seems as if the techs at Otterbox have created a completely frictionless phone case. This made my iPhone X slide into places no phone should ever go.  Consistent only in the fact that the surface chosen to rest the phone on must be plumb and level or else suffer yet another trip to the floor, nook or wormhole.However the case did manage to protect my new IPhone from the dozen or so drops it sustained within 24hrs due to the case itself.Just long enough to order a new case which is perf and return this warm stick of butter surrounding my sweet phone.", "The product is horrible. It says that it has anti yellowing features and it\u2019s already yellow after only having just about three weeks I am very disappointed in the product and would like some explanitaion on this.", "I LOVE this case. Not only is it efficient and 100% genuine in its function, it's also SO PRETTY.", "The case is amazing, but the clear version does scratch easily on the back, returning for the black version now2 weeks later.  The whole back is scratched pretty bad", "Installed on an Iphone XS (2018)This cover was meant to be used in an IPhone X. It fits fine on the XS, except for the speakers at the bottom. Left speaker was shifted to the right and now has 2 of the holes covered up by the case. This does not affect performance of the speakers at all though.The cover is made out of hard plastic with semi rigid rubber areas inside and on the sides. It was very hard to install on the phone because the case does not flex. I thought I was going to break my brand new phone, but eventually got it in.This case provides plenty of protection for the rear cameras. The camera bump sits around 1-1.5mm deep inside the case. This was exactly what I wanted. Most other cases Ive seen are practically flush with the camera.Buttons operate correctly, though a little hard to push. The silent mode switch I find a little hard to get as it sits very deep inside the case. I need long nails to reach the switch.I find the case a little on the slippery side. Particularly the back side. I installed a metal plate such that I could use my magnetic phone holder that I have in my car. Due to the thickness of this case, the phone is held up fine, but not as tight as my previous phone. The slippery back makes me nervous that the phone might slide off.Overall I like it. Plenty of protection, to be tested when I drop this phone eventually.Might eventually change it for something more stylish though.", "I\u2019m not one to write reviews but I felt like I need to for this product. First off, I had this case for my iPhone 8 Plus and it was great. 3 weeks ago I go the iPhone XS and purchased this case thinking it would be great like my last one. Boy, WAS I WRONG. On week 2 of having my phone, I dropped my phone from maybe 3 feet off the ground. It landed flat on concrete. I picked it up and the upper right corner of the phone slipped out of the case which caused the phone to crack between the case and the screen protector. So I thought to myself, maybe user error.... I ended up replacing the cracked screen. A WEEK LATER my phone fell 2 feet from my hand as I was leaning over and fell to the ground. AGAIN the phone slipped from the case and it cracked the bottom right part of my screen protector (thankfully not the actual screen). I am not sure if the case is not tight enough or what, but I DO NOT recommend this case to anyone with an X or XS. I just ordered my MOUS case and cannot wait to throw this one out!"]}
