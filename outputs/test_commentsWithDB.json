            "I'm used to Hanes shirts, and these are very comparable in quality and fit. The large fits my 6'1\" frame correctly.My minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.For the price, these are a fantastic buy.",
            "You are looking at these because you want some white t-shirts but want the cheapest set you can find. These shirts are \"good enough\" for an undershirtz provided that you don't care if they shrink after one wash. If you just wear them under your work shirt and take them off when you get home, these are perfect. If you want to wear these as a shirt by itself, I'm not so sure this is the best option. Maybe I just shouldn't have put this in the dryer but then again other shirts I've done this with haven't shrunk so much.",
            "bad! bad! bad! Very bad quality under-shirts with extremely thin material. All shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere. Never again any product from Gildan!",
            "The shirts are comfortable, but the quality control is bad.  One of the shirts had a little white sticker with a red arrow that pointed to a hole in the shirt. Clearly the QC department marked that as a defective shirt, but it was still included in the package even though it was marked as defective.A couple weeks ago I had bought a pack of the same Gildan shirts at Target and one of the shirts had a 1\" diameter hole in it, so apparently this is an ongoing problem with quality control.",
            "So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting  or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.",
            "Good price for a 6pack of undershirts. Im 6'3, on the lean side, with a basketball in front.A top notch high end Tshirt, I can get by with a true American large.I ordered an XL on these, expecting a good bit of shrink, like I do other bulk pack T's.The XL fits me absolutely perfect out of pack. Not skin tight, but not a moo moo either.Length out of pack is to my fingertips, arms held down,  like a good sport coat length.Hands up, length covers my belt buckle out of pack.Cheap XL = high end L.After one wash/dry, these drew up about 2 inches, shrank about 1/2-1\" over all girth.The fit actually got better, neck is great, but the length is kinda pushing it for moving around, and bending over etc.It will come un tucked under my work shirt. But so does every other cheap bulk pack non-tall shirt.I really probably should've went with a tall size, but these will do fine for an undershirt.Nice summer weight.",
            "2nd time ordering these, these are solid shirts. I mean not sure what some people expect from these after reading the reviews. I ordered the 2x which fit me nicely. I wear these mostly for undershirts and they are just fine. SO if you are looking for some inexpensive shirts, might as well buy these lol",
            "Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts are very comfortable very well made and I would highly recommend them I wear a lot of white shirts and comfort bility and the style and fabric of the shirt is very important to me I  Used to always  Hans but they've got to be very expensive and I don't mind the price but the quality has also been reduced but Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts  Suppress my expectations and if I could give them a 10 star I would I would highly recommend",
            "Good value for well-made T-shirts. These shirts are all I will buy now. Material is excellent and they do not shrink much.",
            "The T shirts seem to be of comparable quality to the Hanes shirt I usually get. I haven't washed them yet to see how much they'll shrink. I'm sure they'll shrink some because they are cotton. I consider myself to be a careful shopper so I was worried these shirts weren't going to be good quality because of the price. I've now learned that Hanes charges too much for similar quality."

            "I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8\" and 140\", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked as well.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer. Also, I think that the Gilden shrank significantly in the first wash. The shrinkage seemed to be in t in the shoulders and in the length. I would say that the T-shirt went from a large to a medium. It still fits but I had wanted a large T-shirt, not a medium.  I washed the T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.",
            "My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.",
            "Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.A great find!",
            "I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.",
            "These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.",
            "Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like. I am a throw it in the laundry and go type so I needed bigger so I could shrink it. I am 250 lbs and 5'11 with a beer gut. I got the 2x and it fit just a touch too big and after 1 wash it is perfect. After a few more washes I might have wished on a 3x but not sure yet. As of now they are perfect and am happy. Only thing that will change when I order more is color and  possible size upgrade if it continues to shrink.",
            "Size was correct. Shirt is soft and comfortable as you would expect of cotton. I will be buying more of these.",
            "These are my husband's favorite shirts, they are thick and durable. We will be buying more.",
            "Purchased as a sleeping shirt for my husband.  From other reviews, it was recommended that I order a larger size, which I did.  They are very comfortable and he loves the fit!",
            "Very disappointed with these T's. After the first washing the bottom hems unraveled. Also the material is super scratchy. They are pretty much useless to wear un-tucked due to the unraveled hems.I have purchased much less costly white T-shirts from Gildan and was quite pleased with them. Would be curious to know if anybody else has had the same situation."

            "I admit that I read the reviews of horrible consistency but the main review I read was posted in 2013 and I stupidly believed Carhartt might have listened in two years. Boy was I ever WRONG!! Sadly I also read far too many of the perhaps BOGUS FAKE REVIEWS that have infected Amazon and hit the purchase now button. DUMB, REALLY REALLY DUMB.... D'oh.....On October 22, 2015 I ordered three Original Fit K-87 t-shirts all on the same order and all came in one package. Here is what I got.Burgundy K-87 T-Shirt - Made In MexicoTan K-87 T-Shirt - Made In HaitiCharcoal K-87 T-Shit - Made In HondurasNone of these shirts fit like the other &amp; none of them are the same weight cloth. This is a ridiculous JOKE. This is my absolute last Carhartt purchase. I keep waiting for the Candid Camera guy to poke around the corner and tell me this was just a joke or that I wake up from the bad dream. Sadly I am awake, and this is what a once good name, Carhartt, has become, a PATHETIC JOKE....It is a shame the failings of America, or rather race to the bottom, have now impacted Carhartt too..... If I had wanted to gamble I would have gone to Vegas... Sad, very, very, very sad... Carhartt you should be ashamed at this horrifically inconsistent  crap you foist upon us!Three shirts, three countries, you can't make this crap up....!!",
            "Once again, not disappointed with the Carhartt shirts I purchased to be embroidered for our construction business. Hunter Green pictured on top of Carbon Heather, Dark Cobalt Blue, and then the navy, all Carhartt brand and original fit. Size LARGE men's and the size is 24 inches under the arm and 32 inches long- from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the shirt. Also bought some size large Guilden brand shirts, and the Carhartt is an inch wider, longer, and the arms are way wider as well. Great quality and I know from past purchases that they hold up with heavy use and heavy washing.",
            "Love these shirts. They wash up well, don't shrink, the neck stays tight. Sure, they are pricier than other tshirts, but well worth the extra money. Others will be long relegated to the rag bag or sleep shirts for your family and these will still be going strong. Bite the bullet and order a few. You won't regret it.I ordered several of these and the Dickies. Very close. These were cut about an inch longer. Other than that, they were virtually identical. The length made the difference for me. Dickies went back and I ordered more Carhartts.But, be advised, they are a heavier material than most. Too heavy to be worn as an undershirt.",
            "I really like these Carhartt t-shirts, I could live in them (I practically do). But, I am looking elsewhere now as these tend to get permanently stained in the pits (I guess from my deodorant but I have no other shirts with this problem) and the fronts get stained from dropped/drooled food. I am not even cognizant of dropping  or drooling my food but I pull these out of the dryer and DAMN! another baked-in grease stain that never goes away. I may be a pitted-out, drooling slob but I don't want to advertise it all the time. I will be trying out other brands/fabrics until I can find a t-shirt that better projects my suave, sophisticated style.",
            "I have bought my husband quite a few Carhartt tees, and he has always liked them. I bought this one a while ago, but just gave it to him at Christmas. He wore it ONCE and we realized there was a loose seam already. It was purchased too far back to return, so I will have to resew the hem. I am NOT happy with the quality and expect a lot more from Carhartt, which is supposed to be durable.",
            "Great shirts and its about all I wear. I liked the light duty shirt but it lagged a little too much with all the junk I carry so these are it. Summer and long sleeves in the fall and winter. I've been a customer since I was a kid. The offshore waters here in the northeast are unforgiving most of the time so I wear their stuff on  the outside too. On these,no ripped off pockets or torn armpits,they wash well and you can't beat them for comfort. I've got cigar burn holes in them and the holes don't stretch out. The little burnholes are still little burn holes when they com out of the wash,good stuff and this is a great deal.",
            "I bought this shirt for my husband in a Medium size and it was a bit too large for him, but still wearable, so we decided to keep it. He has been wearing it at work and he is very happy with the quality of the material, but he doesn't know exactly why. I, on the other hand, am happy with it for the following reasons: thick material, sturdy, well sewn and put together, it cleans  well without remaining stained ( we had issues with work shirts that absorb every tiny speck of dust and then does not come off when washed), and it fits well on the body (although this one a bit too large). By the way, it doesn't shrink when washed. As a result, the husband demanded one  size Small. It is yet to come. We will see which one fits better, and plan to order three more ( one for each day of the week). I strongly recommend this, based on the quality of the product.",
            "My husband is 6' 3\" and 300+ lbs. He requires a shirt with a pocket, a long torso to tuck in and one that doesn't stretch out or lose it's shape. He is very happy with these shirts. He isn't a fan of advertising a brand name but is impressed with the quality.",
            "I have spend over $1,000 on Carhartt products during the last several years.  I have more than a dozen shirts of this exact style and each of them has varied in their cut.  Some shorter than the next, or the sleeves on one come down farther than the others, but these differences have not been enough to stop me from buying the next one.  This time however I was quite disappointed.  The sleeves were noticeably shorter, the overall length was so short that it barely tucks in far enough to stay through the day.  The torso was too wide and the pocket is almost poofy.  I just may try Craftsman for my next T-shirt.  I pay more for these shirts because of the quality and gladly so.  But quality is not just durability, it is also consistency.  I hold Carhartt to a higher standard.  So should they.",
            "I bought 2 different colors of this shirt for my husband. They wash beautifully and fit so well in shoulders, neck, sleeve length and so on.  Carhart always runs a little large, so if a guy is between large and extra large, go for the large.  Quality of fabric is great!  Not thin and flimsy so the t-shirt hangs nicely and is plenty long.I am going to order more colors and throw out all my husband's cheap looking old T-shirts!  (Of course, I have to do this when he is not home...he never discards any of those old, ill fitting, stained ones!) Okay, guys, I know you have your old favs!  I will save a couple!"

            "These t-shirts will shrink bad. I am including a picture of my 6 month old t-shirts (same brand, black) vs. brand new white ones. They're tagless and all, very comfortable and won't fade much, but the shrinking factor might be of your concern especially if you order \"L\". Mine are \"S\" and now they fit like a slim-fit t-shirt which is fine for me but for some this may be relevant.",
            "I bought a couple packages of these in black to use as undershirts for my work dress shirts. I tried them on when the first arrived and the length was good. After a single wash (cold) and dry (warm) they have lost at least 2\" in length, making them near impossible to tuck in and remain tucked in. So for anyone wondering... Yes, these shrink quite a lot in the length.  Interestingly they did not really shrink at all around the chest/waist dimension.A couple other issues I had with these, that I have not had with other brands is that the seam along the bottom of the shirt and around the ends of the arms was not flat. If these were not meant as undershirts I envision I would be going through and having to do some serious ironing to ensure all the seams were down nicely.Lastly, the elastic around the neck seems to be of lower quality material and is not as taunt as I guess I would prefer. It definitely seems like a few washes in, the neck is going to be very loose and \"bacon-ie\" looking.I certainly will be looking to other brands from here on out.",

            "The shirts are not 100% Cotton as stated in the Hanes banner on web page (feel like mostly polyester); the sizing is completely off as measured and compared to the sizing chart on the web page; the 'black' that I ordered appears to be gray/charcoal; I have purchased many 'ComfortSoft' T-Shirts made by Hanes and these are not like those that I have purchased from other retailers in the past: they are course to the touch, heavyweight, and sized inappropriately.  Finally, the shirts arrived in a white plastic bag.  When opened, there were four shirts crammed in as if they were grabbed off a shelf and shoved into a bag.  No Hanes packaging, etc.  Odd.  Unlike any Amazon purchase I have received in the past.",
            "Nothing close to \"ComfortSoft\" at all as stated. Even after several washes and dry, these shirts are still itchy and uncomfortable and if you are wearing it during warm days you will sweat in them and it will become itchy on your skin. I wear this as my undershirt for work while wearing my uniform-issued short sleeve button down shirt and I'm already sweating within minutes. I had 3 older versions of Hanes ComfortSoft Ts  just like these ones before and they were very soft and not itchy to wear. The material was perfect and not too thick or too thin. These newer ones here are just ridiculously too thick and itchy.",

I buy smalls in hanes mens tshirts at the store just for around the house so i knew my size atleast for the plain white ones. I dont like it fitted but i dont wanna look like im drowning either. Im more of a athletic build size 4 or a 26 pants or 3-5 in juniors. Tops in womens i always get smalls im not overly busty 34c an these fit great. I prefer hanes for the simple fact the are longer than other brands an dont look boxy after a few washes not to mention no tags truely a great tshirt. Fyi i notice white tshirts always tend to shrink more than the colored shirts not sure why but in my experience thats what happens but still fit just a bit more form fitting. An just an fyi if a female is lookong for a tshirt for lazy days or whatever or just to wear on ick days if you have a little belly on ya nice cover for those days but if you have yourself a belly that is more obvious this may not be what your looking for or maybe try a size up.",

We submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a 20% restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying. We tried washing a couple times to see if they would get any better but no luck. So we are now using as cleaning rags. So if you\u2019re okay with low quality itchy and rough undershirts, then buy these!",

I used them for years until the material was worn out. So, I thought I would buy more. Amazon sent me HeavyWeight shirts with tags. So I returned them and hoped to get actual ComfortSoft shirts. The second ones sent by Amazon were close, but still incorrect. They sent ComfortSoft HeavyWeight shirts. The material is thicker and slightly scratchy. The neckline bunches in the front. I will not buy these again through Amazon."

            "OK, if you are like me and are trying to find those awesome Champion t-shirts that you have had for years, this is definitely NOT that shirt.  I think I got mine, years ago, at Sam's Club so I came on here to get more.  The old shirts were made of nice, thick cotton with a great fitting neck and a strong collar.  The collar on this shirt is non-existent (See Pics).  The  I am 6'2\" and 270lbs (I like to think all muscle but I am kidding myself) and the old shirts fit perfectly.  I do have some in the 2XLT and I like those even better.  Either way, they were just great shirts and I wanted more.  I mean, for an $8 shirt is is just \"OK\" and doesn't fit anything like the old shirts.  It isn't as long..  I wouldn't have bought it had I seen it in person but I will keep it.  It is that new stretchy and polyester feeling \"Cotton\" that I am not a fan of.  Maybe, I was just disappointed that this shirt was not like the ones I hoped to replace.  I did however, order multiple brands with this order so I will review them, too.",
            "So I ordered dozens of the different Champion shirts on Prime day (in black and grey) because I like the fit. I did notice that Amazon has multiple product listings for these shirts that look almost identical, but not quite if you look closely at the images and the product titles. I ended up ordering a bunch of both since I didn't know what the difference would be.So the cotton for this particular Champion Jersey is so much softer than the cotton for the other, almost identical, Champion Jersey on Amazon. This one is titled \"Champion Men's Classic Jersey T-Shirt\" and notice it has the Champion emblem on the front that is darkened to match the shirt color. There's also another brightly colored Champion emblem on the side of the sleeve for this shirt. Again this shirt is super soft cotton.The other Champion shirt on Amazon titled \"Champion Men's Jersey T-Shirt\" that has much rougher cotton is the one with brightly colored emblem on the front. It fits and looks good, but the cotton on it is much more rough and abrasive. Here's the link to it (rough cotton one):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EG81U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Champion Men's Jersey T-Shirt, BlackKeep in mind, I only ordered black and light grey from each of the two product types so I can't say if they'll all be this soft, but these colors are definitely softer than the black and grey shirts from the other product listing on Amazon. Definitely go with these if you like soft cotton.",
            "These fit as expected until washed and then they shrank. I've been buying Champion Ts for a long time and the latest batch I bought does not measure up to the quality of ones I bought previously. These are very thin, they had a lot of loose threads hanging on them and one already has a hole in the underarm (may have been from a loose thread that I cut off). If you are expecting them to be similar to ones you ordered a year or so ago, you will be disappointed in both the quality and workmanship. I won't be ordering these anymore.",
            "Like many men's clothing manufacturers today, these folks have given the public less than what is expected, or at least what I expected and has caused me problems.  It appears that the current trend is to reduce the actual SIZE of the garment while keeping the POSTED SIZE you expected the same ... in other words, what WAS  X-Large a year or so ago, NOW appears to be a Large shirt but is marked as X-Large.  Yes I am a bigger guy and wear X-Large shirts, but now I have to buy 2X shirts, because they are the \"NEW XL\". When I ordered this shirt, I anticipated the problem and ordered 2 XL, but even it was too small.To check things out, so you don't think I've hit the pasta too much, I've laid the new shirts over similar shirts bought  before, and there are actual dimension difference, even though the shirt is marked the same size as bought before.  Try it yourself and see if that's an issue for you.",
            "Size is slightly small out of the package.. Shrinks another size and a half in the first wash...Material is very thin only slightly better than the cheap T's at Sam's Club...Don't waste your money...",
            "I first discovered Champion T-Shirts at our local Sam's Club over a decade ago. Over the years, they have proved more durable and free from shrinkage than those of the more prominent brands, like Hanes and Fruit. I'm happy to have located them again on amazon.com, and to find them every bit as high in quality as those of the past. In fact, I'm wearing one now.",
            "Fit was fine at first (size XL), but after a single wash - on normal with cold water this shrank 1 1/2 sizes and is now between a medium and large (same with the other 3 colors I bought, so it isn't just this one shirt/color). My old Champion and Russell shirts that I washed and dried at the same time are still true to size. Extremely disappointed. will see if its possible to return as in my opinion this is most definitely a defective product.",
            "Tee shirts are much flimsier than I expected, but they will be okay for work.They don't make them like They used to ! I'm 5' 9'' tall and weigh just under 200 lbs. The X- Large fit well. They are (according to label) all cotton, but they don'thave the 'nice cotton' feel to them like My old ones have. Again, okay for work, and okay for the price.",
            "I purchased six of these shirts and have bought eight more of these previously. My review is for all the shirts in this order. In my opinion, Champion makes the best of these kind of shirts. They hold their shape and color well and last a long time. They are perfect for work shirts and simply to work out. Soft and lightweight, they can be worn for any casual situation and you don't overheat in them during the summer. They are the best everyday tee shirts for the money.",
            "After a single wash the stitching was coming loose around the right arm as well as down around the bottom of the shirt.  It was a little small but I kept it anyway but now after a single wash it is literally falling apart.  I wear several different Champion products and like the brand but this shirt which is made is Honduras is a low quality product.  I have noticed that sweat pants I have ordered vary a little in how they fit, but they seem to be well made and they are made in El Salvador.  Stay away from these shirts!"

            "I'm not sure of the value of yet another review w/1000+ reviews for these shirts. However, I'll add my two cents... These are great if you want a v-neck that stays hidden (the shirt is relatively wide V at the neck) under a dress shirt with the top button(s) unbuttoned. These are great if you want a v-neck that stays tucked in to the pants (the shirt is relatively long). These are great if you want a v-neck that fits relatively well as an undershirt (the shirt isn't tight but it is not a loose fit around the arms and torso). These are great if you want a v-neck that works well under short-sleeved shirts (the shirt has relatively short sleeves). Hope that helps...",
            "I bought these shirts in July; I now bought many more to fully replace my other well made T shirts. I said that these \"fit as expected\" because there is no \"fit entirely better than expected\" category. The manufacturer's claim of super-soft material and lack of coming untucked rang so true to me when I was reading the description for my re-order. They are so comfortable for both reasons. Again, I am replacing all my T shirts with these; my others are reasonable--hopefully someone will benefit via Goodwill--but these are just great as far as I am concerned. Note also that it takes a lot to motivate me to write a review. Parenthetically, I have benefitted greatly from Amazon reviews, so for anyone writing incisive comments, thank you.",
            "Based on the reviews, you\u2019d think white v-neck undershirts might be the most inconsistent product for sale here. Every time I go to reorder some, the model is no longer available and I have to go searching for another version. When I could not find a good Hanes ComfortSoft version to reorder, I tried this one, and I\u2019m glad I did! It\u2019s fitted in the chest and arms, which doesn\u2019t make you look like a dweeb with extra fabric hanging off. It\u2019s also long enough to comfortably tuck in without looking like a belly shirt after one wash. I\u2019m 5\u201910 and 180 lbs and the medium is perfect.",
            "Finally a shirt that fits my body shape - tall and lanky. I'm 6'1 and 155 pounds. Regular large size t shirts fit in length but are too baggy, and mediums fit in size but are not long enough. These fill both categories. Be careful washing on high heat though, some of mine have shrunk to the point that they are quite tight in my chest area, and just barely long enough to keep a button up shirt tucked in. Only negative is that the sleeves are very short, like almost a tank top. My armpit hair sticks out when just standing there, and I am not an overly hairy guy. TMI.",
            "The dimensions on the \"Small\" Tucked T Shirts are as follows!30\" Tall/Long6.5\" from neck to shoulder seam17\" from shoulder seam to shoulder seam19\" wide when laying flat6\" from bottom of V to the collar7\" from shoulder seam to hem of sleeveThe quality felt pretty good and comfortable.",
            "I ordered based on many reviews saying it ran big. I ordered a Large and I'm 6'0 200lbs and it was long enough but rather tight in the body and arms. Arms were also slightly short, so I think the sizing is correct and they do not run large. It's an undershirt so could still wear it just rather uncomfortable for me. If you like your undershirts fitted maybe go a size down and I'm usually an XL.",
            "They are cheaper than the stores, which is great. They definitely shrink - and you should know this. This is nothing new - you need to know this before you order. Order a size bigger, they will shrink a whole size. Guaranteed. You should not be mad when this happens.The problem is when someone wants to wear them as a \"t-shirt\", and not as an undershirt. Because they will be always be too long - if you get the proper size - because they are supposed to be this way.",
            "I wear these under dress shirts and short sleeve button downs.Here is why I will keep buying these year after year.1. The cut of this V-Neck does not show when I leave the top button(s) unbuttoned on my dress and short sleeve button down shirts. This is a must for more casual use of my dress shirts.2. The length is long enough that this shirt tucks into my pants and does not come out when I raise my arms or reach down to tie my shoes. It's annoying when shirts come out of my pants and need adjusting. These are longer than normal and serve that purpose.3. These shirts are just the right thickness. They are not too thin that you can see through them and they are not too thick that they bunch or show that you are wearing an undershirt.4. Buffering layer: They are also just the right thickness and softness  to a) absorb sweat and b) buffer my skin from the outer shirt.5. Price: I'm very happy about the price for this six pack. Thank you!",
            "The shirt I received really are tagless and the fabric feels nice (for the price).My main issue is the size - I'm a 5\"11 man, rather slim but I wouldn't say skinny. I ordered a Small (the smallest size they carry) and the shirts might as well be dresses - they reach well below where by butt ends and the sleeves half way to my elbows. I feel like a little boy wearing his dad's clothes.In the picture you can see a side-by-side comparison of a Hanes small vs. one of these Fruit of the Loom small.So if you're an 8\" monster - congratulations, a size small would look great on you.I'll report back if there's any change after a few more cycles in the washer.",
            "I love these. I like them to fit pretty tight since i wear these under polos and dress shirts and i don't want them really baggy. I wear a Large in polos so i bought these in medium. They will shrink a little after you wash them the first time. They fit really tight over the shoulder and bicep and the sleeves are really short so you don't have to worry about them hanging out under your short sleeves either.! I now have a bunch of these. I currently have black, white, and grey. They are great quality at cheap price. They aren't super thick which i like since i'm wearing them under something else. Every one that i have received has been tagless. I saw some complaints of people getting ones with tags on them but none of the ones i order has had any tags.The one in the picture i have attached has been worn and washed at least 3 times. Hasn't faded at all and hasn't shrunk at all since the first wash."

            "I want to start our by saying that I am, in general, happy with both the quality of the product and the timeliness of the delivery.I used to buy Champion tee shirts ;with featured a decent weight fabric and a generous cut.  A few years back Champion was bought out by Fruit of the Loom and the fabric got lighter, and the cut got skimpy--now resembling the Fruit of the Loom tee shirts.I then switched to Dickies (regular weight) which I can buy at Walmart.  It featured an even heavier fabric and an even more generous cut than the Champion tees of old.  I am happy with the Dickies standard weight tees.  But Walmart carries them in on black, white and gray only.  I wanted colors.I ordered the Dickies heavy weight. When it arrived I tossed it in the laundry along with a brand new Dickies standard weight.  When they were laundered I handled both and they did not feel much different.  I examined the construction and they appear to be the same quality (excellent).  The heavy weight was made in Nicaragua, and the standard weight was produced in the Honduras.  But both seem of similar assembly quality.I decided to weigh them on my kitchen scale:  Stardard weight (XL) 9.25 ounces; Heavy weight (XL) 9.75 ounces a difference of 1/2 ounce (5.26%).  Hardly a heavy weight.So if you are not interested in colors, I recommend the standard weight; if you want the colors go with the heavy weight.If you want a true heavy weight tee I only know of Duluth Trading whose tees are of a true heavy weight fabric and the cut is generous but the product is expensive.  I find the Dickies to be a much better value.  For tall men, the Dickies are available in a \"tall\" too.A good product, but not really a heavy weight.",
            "The Dickies Men's Short Sleeve Heavyweight Crew Nick t-shirts are great! We ordered in 6 different colors. I know this might sound crazy but husband and I have been searching for the past 3+ years for t-shirts that would meet the following basic criteria:1. Heavy Weight Cotton2. Will survive going through the washer more than a dozen times.3. Minimal shrinkage after washing/drying4. Not See-Through -- no secondary shirt needed5. Little to no graphics6. Tag-lessThe Dickies t-shirts exceeded our expectations. The t-shirts are the thickness of the cotton that used to be the norm in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's.  Most t-shirt companies have made the cotton thinner, and thinner and thinner. To the point the men might start wearing man bra's. The Dickies t-shirts do not have obnoxious graphics added (which is also hard to find). The front pock contains a small Dickies logo. Another positive, the inside back neck is \"tag-less\".We like these t-shirts so much, that I'm tempted to order another dozen or two for upcoming years.",
            "I love these shirts. I now own around 12 in various darker colors. They are great fitting and nicely made. The material is indeed thicker than usual, yet not heavy or stifling in heat. They do have two problems, however: 1) The colors fade, and some of them do so very quickly. Gray seems to hold up best. Green and brown are losing a lot of color saturation with every single wash. 2) These things are oil STAIN MAGNETS. You may not notice anything while wearing them or doing the laundry, but later, it's not uncommon to take a \"clean\" one off the hanger and notice a few spots, then throw it right into the hamper. None of my other shirts do this, from cheap 100% cotton tees to poly blends.For both of these problems, I'm only knocking off one star because I really do love these shirts otherwise. There must be something that other manufacturers are doing to protect their fabric, but Dickies is not. For now, I'm keeping a bottle of\u00a0Grandma's Secret GS7001 Laundry Spray, 16-Ounce\u00a0near the washing machine. I've found it works fairly well. Usually.",
            "I'm 6.2 and 205 and don't like short sleeves crowding into my armpit, so I normally go up a size so that my shoulder seam drops over the side of my upper arm by an inch or so. In this case I took the suggestions about going up a size again due to these running small?So XL normally works and I like the shirt tail to be longer so I want to tuck them in and they will stay put!Based on the reviews here, I ordered the 2XLT, so when these arrive the seam between the upper part of the sleeves and the shoulder rides just over the top of my shoulder, but the sleeve are still a bit short by 3/4 to even a full inch. They had a bit better fit before washing and I don't use a dryer for most of my cloths. Anyway, I'm keeping the shirts, the collar seems to be well made and keep it's shape so that's important as well.Note: Shirts from another order were made in Pakistan and were not stated as being \"heavyweight\" shirts.they feel about the same (a bit softer maybe) and yet the fitting is better with about 1/2 in more sleeve than ones from this order, which were made Nicaragua? Laying both out seam to seam and the sleeve on the Pakistan was a bit longer than those from Nicaragua, both shirts had been washed twice!IMO - the material that is being used today vs. the past are not going to hold up as well as shirts from late 80's and early 90's which in my case held up well past 20 years or more and many were made in the USA.",
            "Possibly the best crew neck T I've owned.  Love the fit. Its comfortable, and the collar doesn't loosen after a day of working in it. There is a WORLD of difference between these and the standard Gildan/Hanes tees available at Walmart or similar stores. I'll never go back to a traditional tee after owning these heavyweight ones. It's also much better than the Pro Club brand, which was highly recommended by a couple guys I work with. I actually wear these out daily while getting groceries or doing other things because I like them so much.",

            "I bought this shirt because of it's pocket, high rating, and low price.  I'm dissapointed.  First, if your a big guy, NFL, lumberjack, you'll probably love this shirt.  I'm 5'11, 165 lbs, career military.  This fits me nice in the shoulders and chest, but hangs like a dress around my middle, because there is NO shape or form fitting.  I could live with that.  Wouldn't be the first shirt made for larger people that I have to have tailored to fit me below the chest, but here's the real kicker.  There's something about the design of the sleeves and the weight of the fabric that causes the whole shirt to lift up and bunch around the chest and neck if I lift my arms up shoulder height or higher.  That's definitely something you don't want in a T-Shirt that is supposed to be soft and comfortable.  This cotton is pretty stiff.  Maybe after a few washes it'll be softer, but it seems like a fairly stiff weave.  It certainly doesn't hang/drape like the pictures shown.  Lastly, the pocket, as shown in the picture, wraps around the side of the chest and is largely useless except for keeping a pen in.  It does have a separate little pen spot in the pocket, but the opening is too small to use most modern pens with a rubberized grip.  So, all in all, pretty disappointing for me.",
            "I bought these in a 2X and a 2X tall to see which would fit best. I am going to stick with the 2X tall. I am 5 foot 10 230 pounds. These are made with heavy material and they help conceal my fire arm when it\u2019s on my hip. In fact these are the only T-shirts I will buy from here on out. I have bought one in every color both in a short sleeve and long sleeve. What you need to know about the two. The longsleeve ones tend to be a little longer at the hip and the sleeves hang a little long (remember I order tall) it take a little time to shrink up to the proper length. The non tall long sleeve was a little short on me after washing several times.",
            "I like these shirts very much but it depends. I buy the 2XT shirts. I buy the tall because when I bend over, I don\u2019t have any offensive backside views to contend with. It seems the shirts are made in two different geographic locations. Mexico and Pakistan.  The Mexican made shirts have the horse shoe logo on them and the Pakistan shirts have a more traditional logo on them. The Mexican shirts fit well till after you wash and dry them. Then, the sleeves don\u2019t cover up the bicep area well and the tall becomes meaningless.  The Pakistani made shirts are the total opposite. They hold their shape and stay true to being tall after many multiple washes and drying. I think the company that owns the Dickie products needs to ditch the Mexican manufacturer and give all their business to Pakistan. I hate to say that as an American but when you\u2019re paying the same amount for both and one is completely more superior than the other; it is what it is."

I have only had 2 that had bad stitching, but a bad trip to the laundromat could have caused that. I will never wear another shirt.However, they are pretty long and the sleeves are pretty small. The overall fit is great. But an inch shorter on the length would be great and maybe about a quarter inch around the sleeves too for that absolutely perfect fit. If you're husky at all, don't bother. You wont like them even in the larger versions.",
            "****************IT'S BEEN A YEAR!**I've been blessed to basically live in these shirts for over a year now. I've never had a relationship like this with a t shirt... i now know for sure that it is love. My baby is 15 months old and I've managed to lose 15 lbs, so the shirts were getting a little loose. I'm cheap. And I'm resourceful. I took in an inch on the sides of these suckers and they're as good as new(ish).*****************My husband fell in love with this brand after he wore one from a local gym. He took note of the brand and then started searching the internet for it. Luckily he found it on Amazon. He knew to go up a size so it would fit better. He bought one, and then two more. And then three more. They are really soft and are a good fit (remember to go up a size).Another thing he really likes about it is that they are long enough (but not crazy long) to cover his concealed carry when he carries on his belt. He also likes the sleeve length, because as he proudly puts it, \"they show off my biceps\"This is a little embarrassing, but I started liking his shirts... so I made him buy me one. And now I think I have four. No, I have five. They are just really comfortable. It's not like I'm dressing up for my toddlers, so I wear them all the time. And to Wal-Mart. Because they're actually one of the nicest plain t-shirts I've ever worn. Comfortable enough to wear to bed as well. And, yeah, I'll just say it, not all t-shirts are great for breastfeeding with, but these are great. They aren't stiff; they have enough give, but also keep their shape.These are our favorite t-shirts and we'll probably keep ordering them and end up wearing them as senior citizens, and possibly request to be buried in them because, hey, they're really comfortable.",
            "HALLELUJAH!I have been searching for years for a form fitting plain t-shirt, and I think I've found it. I have read hundreds of reviews where no one bothers putting their measurements, which I find absolutely useless for anyone else, so hopefully my review helps some of you. I was skeptical at first, just like every other time I've purchased a cheap t-shirt online (too short, too slim, too blocky, too wide, uncomfortable material), but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shirt on.I am 6'4\", 215-225 lbs and fit, so length and slimness is important to me. I bought an XL, and the length is incredible (if maybe not slightly long for some, but probably perfect after a wash). Not too often you get an XL with a cheap shirt and they keep it slim fitting rather than extending the width 15 inches assuming you're only going up a size because you're 300lbs. It fits the shoulders great. The XL extends to the ends of my shoulders ALMOST perfectly (sorry, don't have exact measurements to help here). As for the sleeves, another bonus! We all have hatred for flared sleeves and they feel like they're inevitable in cheap t-shirts. I have around 15\" cold biceps for reference and they hug the biceps all the way through without being too tight. They extend not too far past the halfway point in the bicep which I prefer (picture is accurate). Lastly, the material is very comfortable. The pictures were a bit deceiving when I was trying to guess how the material would feel but I can say my expectations were surpassed.Hopefully this helps out fellow brothers my size. I know this is the type of review I would try to scour for before purchasing, but with little success.",
            "The perfect fit, the perfect fabric, the perfect selection. We got them in every color and we don't regret it. If you've got a long torso and a particular need for softness, this is the shirt for you. The neon green/yellow is great for public events with a crowd.",
            "So far I\u2019ve purchased six different kinds of white T-shirts and this one is the most soft.It is kind of see-through which is what I\u2019m trying to avoid, hence why I\u2019d buy six different kinds of white T-shirts, but it is probably the best out of all of them.It\u2019s probably the least see-through out of all of them.It seems to be good quality, too.So if you\u2019re reading these reviews looking for softness, get it.If you\u2019re looking for a 100% non see-through white shirt, this isn\u2019t exactly the one but try it if you want. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it for how soft it is.",
            "I'm 5'7\", have a muscular build, weigh about 168lbs. This shirt is very soft and it didn't overtly shrink in the wash/dryer. It's a great fit. I plan to buy more now that I know the cut is nice. The sleeves aren't too long and there's plenty of room in the chest and lat areas so you don't feel constricted but it's still form fitting. Awesome shirts.",

I bought one, got it, tried it on, and went back immediately and bought 10 more in different colors.I wear them all the time, casual with jeans, dress up with slacks, although I find their colors don't really suit active wear.  I mean, they are comfortable but look a bit out of place for active wear.  Maybe because they are just plain shirts, no logos or anything, and active wear I guess is suppose to be moving billboards...but yes, I wear them at the gym because I really don't care and they are just so super soft comfy.",
            "One of the best fitting t-shirts ever worn, this is without a wash, hopefully it doesn't shrink. I'm 5'11\", 175 lbs and a large fits well, but maybe just a tad too long. The sleeve length and tightness is spot on and the body section tapers down toward the waist. If you like the original plain volcom t-shirts you'll probably also like this fit and material, they are both about the same weight only $10 cheaper. If you have a thin triangular torso shape, and have a hard time finding shirts to fit because most U.S. shirts are designed to fit people over weight, then this shirt is for you. Not too tight, not too loose, just about perfect.",
            "I bought seven of these in different colors.  They are really soft and fit very well.  I bought the XL for my 42 inch chest and they fit nicely. My only complaint if you can call it that is that the colors could be more vibrant.  Don't misunderstand they are quite similar to the colors shown but could be as I said more vivid.  Very good value for the money.  The seams are well stitched with double rows, the sleeves come down about three quarters of the way down my bicep and don't ride up.  I'm reviewing all seven that I purchased in this one review."

Fortunately for me the chest/waist are not billowy, but it is the typical \"American\" fit but not so awfully billowy.But... as I'll only wear this around the house and yard, or for running errands, I would re-order.

            "Great shirts fr the money, I one several colors. I order XXL and they shrink to the perfect XL size for me. The cloth is very comfortable and warm. The thickness of the material seems to vary by color and when you purchase the shirts. Some of my white long sleeves are thinner than other ones I own. I would suggest this as a good shirt to purchase. Buy one size larger and after a warm wash and drying it will shrink perfectly.",
            "Extremely comfortable and durable shirt. It runs slightly big, but it's crazy comfy",
            "These were perfect for field wear! Got them in the largest possible size so they could be worn over multiple layers if need be. No need- wore them over a tank top and they kept out mosquitoes, horseflies and all manner of dirt. I spent 8-10 hours a day in these, pushing through Devil's club, stinging nettle, fallen trees and thick shrubs- not a single snag or tear. Soaked up a ton of sweat, washed out nicely and kept me from being eaten alive by bugs. Now that field season is over, they're great for yard work!",
            "These shirts came in a two pack, not tagless. The fit is as expected not too big and not too small. The quality is alright, I mean at around $5 each shirt - I guess I cannot complain and expect amazing quality. I wish the shirt was a little softer as the material is a stiffer material and thick. Because of this, I would give it 4/5. The color is also fading a little faster than some of the other long sleeve shirts from other brands. For the price - this can't be beaten, but I wish the quality was a bit better.",
            "It fits great when you try it on before washing it. Both shirts shrunk at least a full size during the very first wash/dry. Too small for comfort now, so I gave them to my wife for night shirts. She likes them for that purpose.I haven't given up on Gildan yet, though. I bought two in a different color...one of the colors that has both cotton and polyester. I'm hopeful the polyester will help prevent shrink.Before these white ones shrunk, they were a perfect fit.",
            "Nice shirts, I never owned gildan products ! Wanted some cool / white long sleeve tshirt for summer. Slightly tight but I didn't want to order to big and have sleeves to long, washed them immediatelyPulled and stretched them a bit hung out to dry in air, perfect now  ! I'm  5'11\", 200lbs . Yes, I recommendThese fast shipping, no need to go to stores looking , Amazing Amazon, easy fast / great prices",
            "Not sure how these shirts garnered all the great reviews, but that has NOT been my experience with these shirts. I purchased 4 if them based solely on the reviews, but all 4 are already fading and coming apart at the seams (literally) after only 3 wash/wear cycles! I like the comfort of the material itself, but the workmanship is pretty deplorable. I cannot recommend these shirts to anyone.",
            "True to size and not thin at all, very good weight to the material and nice and soft and no major shrinkage after washing.  The cuffs are perfect."

Material feels thick, with \"champion\" embroidered on the left chest area, and my biggest concern was relieved as there was another champion logo embroidered on the left sleeve. My initial worry was if there was a champion logo on the left sleeve since the picture does not indicate one. I'm 5'5, 125lbs and went with my true size in clothing, Small. Fit exactly how I expected, not too snug, length of t-shirt and sleeves fit me fine.",

PLEASE ORDER A SIZE DOWN.\"What the heck does THAT mean? I went by the Amazon size chart: my waist is 35-36, and chest is 42, so I ordered an L.It's too small. If I had \"ordered a size down,\" I would have ordered a Medium, and it would have been MUCH too small.Dear Champion:  Please just stop being stupid.Thanks.",

The size was printed on the inside of the back of the shirt).  The material on this one was coarse. (The Champion product material was smooth.)",

            "I bought this for Valentine\u2019s Day. My husband hates long sleeve shirts but it was pretty cold so I figured this would combat some cold weather a bit. He\u2019s between sizes (medium and large) but I got a medium and it fit great. His sleeves were perfect and the length was awesome. Not too long and not too short after washing. It lifts up some and he's about 5'10. If you're taller, I'd size up because your belt/boxers may show. This was the perfect cheap yet quality shirt I\u2019ve bought him in a long time. It\u2019s thin like not for winter wear where you wouldn\u2019t need a jacket but more like 60 degrees this would be enough by itself.",
            "This is a nice long sleeve t-shirt for SUMMER / WARM weather use. Construction quality is good / very good.It is NOT a heavy weight t-shirt. I wish it was, but it is not. It is not chinssey 'paper thin' either, it is somewhere in the middle of a great heavy weight T (the old Jerzees T shirts I still have and love) and a el' cheap-o T shirt.If you buy it with the intentions of keeping some sun off your arms in warm weather, for that purpose you will be satisfied. In cooler weather I wore this long sleeve T and another print screen type heavy weight short sleeve T over the long sleeve T. This layered combo worked great for 50 - 60 degree temps.Sizing;  I ordered the medium, and it was slightly small. Given a wash and a dry in the dryer (shrinkage) and it would have been too small. I sent back the mediums for Large. The large fit me perfect. I am 5'11+ (almost 6'), 44 chest, 33 waist, 185 pounds.Hope this review help you.  If yes... give the review a vote !  Thanks !",
            "I bought this long sleeve t shirt to wear for outdoor exercise when the weather cools down a bit. It's nice and light, and wicks moisture. The one aspect of this shirt that makes it stand out for me is the fit, which is spot-on for the marked size. I am pretty much a perfect size medium (5'8\" and 160 pounds, with an athletic build) but in some cases I get stuck buying a large because the medium is too tight across my chest and shoulders. In those cases the large is always too long in the body and arms which makes it look and feel sloppy. This Jerzees shirt is proportioned just right for me in my actual size. This will be my go-to brand for this type of shirt from here forward.",
            "Ordered a medium &amp; was a good shirt.  Was comfy but just a little roomy but not that big of a deal.  I'm assuming i can shrink it if it tried &amp; it won't be as roomy since it's 50% cotton.",
            "I like this shirt because the bottom is long enough to go past my pockets and does not feel like it is riding up when I move and the sleeves and long enough when I stretch out my arms it doesn't look like the shirt is to small. its a little thicker than the Hanes Men's Long Sleeve Nano T-Shirts I got at the same time but they are not so thick that I can't put another short sleeve shirt on over it. i would recommend this shirt just a little more than the hanes but only because it is a little thicker and i live in a place where it gets cold.",
            "Well, they're a little snugger than I expected, but I love the fit. They are not tight at the arm pits, it's just intended to be a form-fitting shirt. Very nice. I am a tall-ish woman with arms 3/4 inch longer than \"average,\" so the sleeves of shirts and tops made for women are always too short. A men's size small has been my go-to for decades. These shirts seem to \"breathe\" well. I am active in an unheated part of a large building and wanted long sleeves, but hopefully not a fabric so thick that I can't cool off during the times when I have a lot of lifting and shuffling boxes to do. These are perfect. They have a lovely, soft feel, not nylon-y. I've been washing them on the delicate cycle, drying them half way dry, then hanging them to finish drying.  I think the instructions are just wash/dry, but I want these to stay new looking. Quality shirts.",
            "I needed lightweight long sleeve large roomy shirts for hiking (long enough to cover my behind) and these do the trick well enough. I thought I wanted cotton, but the 50/50 blend and the light weight really works much better than my heavy cotton shirts which just get heavy with sweat as opposed to these shirts which are light enough to dry as I hike.My one gripe is that of the 4 shirts I bought, THREE of them sprung a hole in the same place - the seam on the arm right by the cuff. The seam came open and on one of the unraveled so that the whole cuff came off. I put a few stitches on the seam near the cuff on the others and they've been fine.",
            "I bought this shirt to use as part of a Halloween costume and didn't really plan on wearing it after that. After trying it on and realizing how comfortable the shirt was, I think it's going to find it's way into my regular rotation (I know I stole this line from the Simpsons, but it applies). The fabric feels great, and the bright red really does pop. The sleeves are a good length for me, something which is not always the case with shirts since i have long arms. I purchased a size larger than normal half-expecting the shirt to run small, but this was not the case. It fits exactly as I'd hoped a shirt of the size up would, which is great for me really since I prefer baggier clothes to tighter. I am very happy with this shirt, the price was right, and it's exactly what I was looking for.",
            "The shirt was delivered promptly with no defects. Personally I am looking for a work shirt. This shirt seams light weight and a bit on the stretchy side. Cotton blend might be a little excessive for my purposes. The only thing I didn't really like about the shirt is that the length is a bit short. the fact that it's a little more slippery than a cotton shirt makes it fairly likely that it's. It going to stay in my belt through a work day. So at least in my case it's not really a great work shirt but lesson learned. If you need it for another reason especially if you need good ventilation and movement with a comfortable feel on your skin this is a good value for the money.",
            "I've been buying a lot of long sleeve shirts lately to replace old ones.  I've tried a few different brands and this is one of my favorites.  I did buy XXL even though I'm typically an XL.  I've found recently that XL is more like a Large, so I'm buying XXL first now.  This fits me perfectly.  I'm 6' 2\", 210lbs."

            "Simply can't beat the cut and fit of these shirts. I am that odd size between medium and large. I ordered a medium and it fits amazingly, I have since bought 7 or 8 of them I like them that much. They are cut like a fitted shirt so the sleeves are a little tighter than a normal t-shirt and really makes for a great fit. I've washed them probably 5 or 6 times and the royal blue one has faded a little but hasn't shrunk or fit any differently. They breath awesome and flex great, I seriously can't say enough about how much I love these shirts.",
            "I used Russell T-Shirts for years, but the price and quality seemed to go in opposite directions, to its' detriment.I first got the Carthartt regular t shirts (all cotton), but tried one of these. They have some polyester woven in for moisture wicking. Though I prefer natural fibers on my body, I have to say these T-Shirts are comfortable, wear well, and DO wick away the moisture. The price is a bit steep though, so buy these when there is a sale or Carthartt rebate.I also tried a Dickies t shirt, they came 2 to a pack and were much cheaper in price. I like them as well.Almost forgot, I also chose these because I can get a light tan color which helps in the summer heat and doesn't look as bad if they get a little dirty. Russell seems to have problems carrying the light colors for summer. HTH",
            "Very nice shirt. Bought for my husband. Looks great on him! I snuck in some photos. He wouldn't model for me. Lol its a large. Normally a xl. But carhartt shirts run big.",
            "My husband sweats a lot so I thought I would give this shirt a try, he loves them and wants to wear them all the time.  He  is retired but does work  for a Storm Restoration Company . Recently when he worked a storm, he stayed longer than we packed him to work  I told him I did not dry the shirts after I washed them and they dried looking great, So he washed them in the shower, and hung them to dry over the air conditioner. They dried perfectly for him to wear again. Love these and now I am purchasing long sleeved shirts, but remember these are the Carhartt Men's Force Cotton shirts 65% --35%. They look really nice good thing I got several different colors.",
            "These shirts are just 'okay'.  The material is a nice thickness and the cotton blend is very comfortable.  However, they are made in Guatemala and the sizing seems to be a little 'off'.  I realize they are relaxed fit - which in Carhartt'a nomenclature means 'tighter' than their original fit shirts.  The problem I have with the shirts is the length - both of the shirt and the sleeves.  The photos show the sleeves well above the elbow and in reality, they fall 2-3 inches lower than what the photo depicts.  The shirt length is also long - it's almost like a 'tall' size 3-4\" longer than most medium sized shirts I own.  The chest and shoulders fit about how a medium should.  I'm going to try a small.  I'm not sure if this is a qa/qc issue or if this style shirt is just a little odd.",
            "This is just a nice, comfortable shirt to wear. Cotton shirts have the ultimate feel, but I'm sick of them staying soaking wet forever and shrinking a ton when they dry. The blend in this one seems to keep the best of both worlds. Pocket is nice, not flimsy, and actually usable unlike many other t-shirts. Not a huge fan of the Carhartt logo on the pocket, but not an issue. I bought a 2XL and size seemed pretty true for me. Would definitely buy again and in other colors.",
            "Everybody knows that Carhartt makes some tough products, and these shirts are no exception. They don't fit exceptionally large, they are a bit long though. If you tuck in your shirt this is of course not a problem. The neck hole isn't very spacious, but it still fits me perfectly. I've worked outside for 8 hour days in the sun and these shirts have held up fine and have kept me cool. Yes, they're expensive shirts, but they're completely worth it in my experience. I have bought 5 of these shirts and they've all fit the same and been of the same quality. I have seen them go on sale a few times, so I would scoop them once they hit the &lt;$15 range, that is a very justifiable price for this product in my opinion.",
            "Great shirt heavy material &amp; I like the pen pocket inside the main one, be careful not to over cook it in the dryer it's 100% cotton &amp; will shrink but does stretch out after wearing it some I pull mine out of the dryer when it's still damp.",
            "Fits OK but I wish they offered a 'tall', at 6'5\" the XL is a little short. Also didn't notice that it's only 65% cotton but that's my fault, it says so right there in the description. Otherwise it's fine but I'd like to find a 100% cotton tee in 'XL tall'...",
            "Great shirts for the summer, will be ordering more soon. If you work outside and have to wear cotton clothes these do help from having a sweat soaked shirt. Not as good as a moisture wicking material but if you can\u2019t wear them because of static these are good alternatives."

So most consider me a giant of a human being. My arm length 36-38\" If I remember correctly.  Even when I extend my arms, the sleeves don't come up too much.  Also, I liked that the shirts are long, and that it comes way down past my waist,...which is normally a problem for me.  Other than that,...it's very breathable as described.  As far as durability,...I can't say yet.  I haven't put it through it's paces yet.  To have protection when it's sunny and hot, but still feel comfortable,...I think these shirts are the way to go.",

I ordered the Vapor Apparel UPF Long sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt that the site says has an \u201cup to UPF 50+\u201d.  I received the shirt, put it and another shirt on and went out to walk my dog.  The second shirt I left unbuttoned because it was warm out.  Later in the day I noticed my chest was itching \u2013 big time.  The Vapor T-Shirt did not give me the protection I needed.I sent Vapor Apparel an e-mail asking what their statement \u201cup to UPF 50+\u201d.  This is the response I received from Nick:\u201cThank you for your feedback request on the specifics of the SPF rating of the shirts.  All of the shirts have a minimum SPF ranking of 35.  A couple of the colors rank higher (White for example ranks 58 SPF and Black ranks over 50 spf).  Color has an impact on the manner in which the sun interacts with the fabric.  I know this is not an exact rating \u2013 we are working quickly with the SPF ranking group to get a more universal grade. Most of the colors are scoring in the mid and upper 40\u2019s for SPF.  As you can see we are wanting to be as precise as possible with a challenging color issue.  We are working to address this issue in other ways as well.The shirt ranks very well with customers for protection.  We have received almost universal positive feedback.  If for any reason the shirt does not meet your expectations we can provide you with a full refund.  We hope this information is helpful and you enjoy the shirt.Please let us know if you require additional information.Best regards,NickVapor Apparel\u201dI\u2019m rating this shirt 5 stars because:1- Most purchasers give it rave reviews and,2- The honesty of Nick\u2019s response.Though I did like the looks, feel and price of the shirt it just isn\u2019t able to give me the UV protection I need.",

            "Vapor Apparel makes a very good performance shirt for men - I needed protection from the sun due to numerous skin cancers over the past few years and my Derm Doctor recommended going with shirts having high UPF protection - although Vapor's price point is half of what a HUK shirt would cost if you're really budget restricted but need the protection you probably should look at Hanes Cool Dri long sleeve shirts which are about half the cost of Vapor's shirts - I purchased both and both work well for their intended purpose! As far as the size I found that I could have used a size Large with either brand but they fit me close (maybe not snug) across the chest so I ordered X-Large which fits up top much better to my taste but you have to put up with a longer length in the shirt - if you tuck it in that issue doesn't come into play but if you leave it out then you may want to stay with a Large.",

I was given a catalog and the prices were sky high and beyond my budget but I came here to Amazon and found this shirt. It fits well, looks good and was more than 1/2 off the catalog merchandise. I will definitely be buying more.",
            "Nice shirt for the sun.  Very light material.  Perfect for wearing on a hot day and keeping your skin from burning.  I will use these for golf and fishing in the midday hot southern sun.  The fit is a just slightly smaller than a normal XL so you may want to order one size up.  This shirt is a great bargain compared to similar high end sun protection big logo shirts at four times the price.  You could pay a whole lot more and get the same or less.  Bang for the buck is big if this shirt holds up over time.  I am ordering a few more in different colors.  The material is comfortable next to the skin so you may find yourself wearing it as a base layer.  Seems to wash up nice.  I have looked for a good long sleeve sun shirt for a long time and most of them are too heavy or way overpriced with obnoxious corporate logo's making you a human ad billboard.  I think you will find this sun shirt to be just the right product for the hot sun.  This is my first Vapor product.  I have been wearing these long sleeve Vapor shirts on the golf course in the hot summer sun this past week and they keep you cool and comfortable with minimum sweat factor.  The fit is great and they seem to give easily with activity.  Very impressed with this product - highly recommended!",
            "Great shirt...but it smells weird! I'm not sure if it's the material, the built in sun protection, or something else, but when I received the item (clearly new with tags in a plastic bag), it smelled as if someone had worn it before I got it while taking a brisk walk. It didn't smell disgusting, but it was noticeably musky. I even washed the shirt before wearing it and the smell never went away. That being said, I've worn the shirt several times since I got it and I love it! It keeps me protected and it is not too hot to wear to the beach and leave on for the entire day(even in south Florida). The weird smell remains, but I'd rather deal with that than skin cancer! I bought one in black and it looks nice. I have worn it out to dinner and even to work and nobody noticed it was more of a \"performance wear\" top. I'll be buying one or two more in different colors....the sun is brutal down here! Good bang for your buck.",
            "This shirt exceeds my expectations.  I bought it to wear while playing golf and I live in south FL, where the sun is very bright, very hot between 11 am and 3 pm, and not much breeze.  I wear the shirt under a short sleeve golf shirt (collared shirt required) and it is very comfortable--doesn't restrict my swing at all  and keeps my arms and neck from the sun for 4+ hours.  The sleeves are long enough to cover my arms just over th wrists (35\").  Needless to say I have washed it after play (4 times per wk) and it holds the size and shape very well.  Best recommendation of all, ordering three more so I'm not having to wash one every night for the next day's golf. A great alternative to 50 SPF on your arms twice a round.",

            "This is one issue I've had with the few clothing purchases I've made on line... so often what you see is NOT what you get, which is why I don't often resort to it. I ordered the \"assorted earth tones\" 4 pack, and when you click on the assorted earth tones, what's shown are shirts that look like a steel blue, a brown, an olive green, and I guess what they're calling a \"heather grey\". The description says that they're all 100% cotton, with the exception of the heather grey, which is 90% cotton, 10% polyester. Well, the most important part of the product description is the part that says \"colors may vary\" - you ain't kiddin'!What I ended up getting were two of the EXACT SAME same grayish-blue shirts (90% cotton, 10% polyester) rather than steel blue, a much lighter shade of brown than shown (90% cotton, 10% polyester), and a teal shirt rather than the olive (the ONLY one that's 100% cotton!)These are for my hard-working, blue collar hubby, and he's not really going to care what the colors are - he's always been completely satisfied with the Fruit of the Loom pocket tees I've purchased in the past (he's a big guy, we buy the 3XL size, he likes the way they fit him), and it's nice that they're all tag-less now. But the shirts in this pack are made in El Salvador, and here's what the washing instructions say: \"Para Mexico Lavar Con Detergente/No Exprimir\". My high school Spanish class was a lifetime ago! And I expect to get the colors featured in the \"assorted earth tones\" photo accompanying the choice I clicked on - surely not TWO of the same color, which wasn't even shown!  We like the shirts - just not the misinformation.",
            "With this product you get 4 crew neck t-shirts at an inexpensive price.These undershirts are made of cotton which makes them soft and comfortable.The branding and sizing information is stamped on the back of the inside of these shirts, which is great because there are no tags to cause irritation and itching.These undershirts are fairly thin and lightweight, so if you are doing some heavy construction work (or yard work, or etc.) they aren't the most durable.It must be noted that these undershirts will shrink after a couple washes, which could mean trouble for people who wear these tighter to begin with or have long torsos.I purchased these undershirts to wear under my polo shirts at work.  They fit well and I am still able to tuck them into my pants (even after shrinking in the wash), so I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend that you purchase these undershirts if you have similar needs.-In Short-Pros:InexpensiveComfortableAssorted colorsCons:Will shrink after a few washesNot the most durable*Please click \"Yes\" if you found this review helpful. It would be appreciated. Thank you.",
            "Bought these T-shirts for my son and husband as they are the only shirts my son will wear.  But something has changed and these do not fit like the last ones we bought in the store.  They run small and too long.PROS:  They are soft and don't get twisted when washed.  There is some minimal pilling after multiple wears (like six months of every day wear) but that is to be expected.  Price is great as you get 4 shirts for the price and one shirt in the stores costs $6.CONS:  Size is off.  My son wears a XL and fits XL in other FOL shirts. These ones are way too tight and too long for him.  He said they feel like he's wearing a tube sock as a top. Also, going by the picture we expected two darker grey and two blue but received 3 blue (light blue, darker deep blue, and a grayish blue) and a light grey shirt.",

            "Actually these are great shirts as I've ordered this same package numerous times before. Always received the 4 blues shown in each package. Now I received 2 packages each containing 2 powder blue and 2 light green shirts. Only 2 colors (not 4) in each pack and colors that aren't even shown. Must be from the bottom of the barrel. See picture. I have set up a reship and return. Will update but I'll bet the replacements will be just as bad.Update 2/8/2018 - Of course. Replacements sent are IDENTICAL to my first order. Now I'm looking at 8 powder blue and 8 light green shirts, all of which are going back. Aside from the hassle in all of this, my real frustration is I really love these shirts in the colors shown but nobody at Amazon seems to care about straightening this out and I can no longer order these again.",
            "I'm an average sized guy and purchased a medium.  They were ridiculous  how long they were and bulky with a huge neck opening.  Not even remotely close to the right size. Had to return them. So disappointing."

            "I have used Hanes v-neck t-shirts for years.  Long enough to see a change in quality that\u2019s not good.  So I decided to try a new v- neck.  The Gilman brand was not familiar, but it had good reviews.  So I bought six.  They came shortly after, washed and dried on hot to check shrinkage.  Good news.  They fit as hoped with a long tail, and the material quality is grate.  Good thickness and soft.",

            "Mine are not bad, especially when you get 6 for $12.  A slight bit rough right out of the package but fine after the first wash, which I do with all new clothing.  They are on the cheaper made/materials side but again not bad for the price.  Good work shirt.  I'm satisfied with the purchase.",
            "In general, I\u2019m a picky shopper in terms of quality, but when it comes to undershirts, I only need something of decent quality but at a good price.As a point of reference, for my own use, three Calvin Klein v-neck undershirts at Costco for $19.99 cost more than what I felt was necessary for me (they are definitely of better quality though).So I found these Gildans and gave them a try.  The fact that they cost less than $2 per undershirt worried me so I wasn't expecting much, but they are actually better than expected, given the very reasonable price!  I laundered them once before wearing one, and my initial impression is that they fit great (I ordered Medium size, and I\u2019m a size 39 chest &amp; 33 waist) and are of very acceptable quality considering the price.I then compared them to some old Costco Kirkland V-neck T-Shirts that I\u2019ve had for a very long time.  These Gildans are a lighter thinner cotton, so their durability wash after wash remains to be seen, but I initially have absolutely no complaints for the price.The Gildan cotton definitely feels rougher than the Kirklands, but not enough to prevent me from buying more Gildans for the price. The stitching on the Gildans is not as smooth or refined as the Kirkland\u2019s, but again totally acceptable given the price point.In the end, as long as you aren\u2019t shopping for premium quality, IMHO I feel this is a very good deal on a set of 6 acceptable quality undershirts, and I found them even better than expected.  If durability holds up after a reasonable amount of washes, I definitely plan to buy these again.",

I will write another review if they end up lasting but I'm guessing Gildan is not going to send me a replacement so I recommend just spending the extra buck for a better brand.",

Theirs have tended to get lighter in weight and smaller in size and length as the years have gone by.  These Amazon shirts fit a bit large and the tall is cut very long.  No worries about these coming untucked.  I bought the cotton/polyester blend shirt which is fairly light weight but not too flimsy.  We'll see how they hold up.  My next order is for a 100% cotton shirt.  Have not received the order yet.",
            "These shirts are thick and comfortable. They are cut very big; I order a size down for undershirts so they hug my succulent form, but these are too large to wear underneath another shirt. I'll keep them for nightshirts.",

Be wary of the measurements, either the size variation has no quality control allowing huge swings or they really aren\u2019t accurate.",

I like loose fitting t shirts in general so I will keep these but next time will try the 2X Tall.  As an overall statement on sizing they run large compared to other brands that sell 3 XLTs.  I just bought these and have only worn them once but the shirt is comfortable, relatively light but made well (good for Summer here in Florida), and I think a good buy for $10 ( bought 2 pack for $20).",

Makes me very self conscious to have that much of my neck and shoulders exposed. Too bad, good product otherwise.",
            "The t-shirts fit very well. We often have a problem for my husband who wears a 4x that the t-shirts we get are too small. These are the right size. He is also disabled and the tightness, especially around the arms, constricts him, so these are his favorites and he seeks them out. The fabric is thick but it's very soft. I will buy some more of these when they become available in different colors. I was hesitant to buy the teal but it's pretty dark and it works well."

And I never dry in dryer but for 10 minutes to get mostly dry, then I hanger the rest. Doing this with all shirts like this minimizes ironing and shrinkage over the life of the piece (dryers kill clothes). I marked \"fits as expected\" but that's only because I now expect all clothing to fit differently than what sizes once indicated. I'm the same weight &amp; measurement as I was 2 decades ago (5-9, 185); however, I now sometimes have to buy extra large rather than just large. Clothes are now made all over the world; that has to create sizing problems.",

Since I had great satisfaction from Dickies products before, I thought I would give it a try and buy two of these awesome shirts to wear to work.In all honesty, I really could not have made a better choice than to get two of these.  Not only do they look good, but they FEEL good as well!  Hunter Green and Navy Blue are two of the best colors for my liking.  Additionally, I can also guess that these will likely last a lot longer than the two shirts I had originally, seeing as these are made with thicker material and are seemingly FAR sturdier.  I will definitely buy more Dickies clothes down the road.",
            "Candidate for plumbers crack, I own dozens of Dickies work shirts, all had been purchased at Walmart and the price kept getting higher and higher. Found these on Amazon and ordered 3, luckily I only ordered 3 since I am highly disappointed in the quality and fit of these shirts. I wonder if these are bootleg products? The color fades very quickly, I have old Dickies shirts that have more color than these do and these have only been washed maybe a dozen times. The biggest problem I have is the tails of these shirts are shorter than the ones I buy at Walmart, I spend a lot of time bending, stretching and kneeling at work and I am constantly tucking the tail of these shirts back in, they are a good 1 to 2 inches shorter than the Dickies I buy at Walmart. The Walmart shirts rarely have to be tucked back in but with these it is constant and never ending, it is to the point I don't even want to wear these shirts to work, brand new shirts that I will only wear to mow the grass or lounge around the house what a waste of money, I will not be buying more of these shirts from Amazon.",
            "Carhartt wins hands down. I haven't purchased one of these Dickie's shirts in years and I was somewhat disappointed at the quality of the fabric. The fabric is thinner than I remember and it itches without an undershirt on. The Carhartt shirts on the other hand are a lot thicker and I prefer the way the buttons are placed....with Dickies there is an odd distance between the top button and the next to last button. However Dickies has Carhartt beat on colors hands down. I needed a dark brown work shirt and this was the only one available that I liked. If you live in a warmer climate these will be fine but don't expect a heavy duty work shirt. You will still get a decent shirt and the style is classic.....but it is a little different than what the Dickies shirts I wore in the 80's. Fit is good if not a little \"loose\". Order you regular Dickies sizing. I am an XL at 5'10\" 220 lbs.",
            "I'd say this item fits a little large - except that that's exactly how it should. The fabric is unstretchy, and I feel will surely last years and years, as it feels so durable. It's not uncomfortable, but it's not cotton, either, and you shouldn't expect to be reaching for these for a day of lounging on the couch after busting ass all month, wearing them.I presume they'll take wear very well, but they're not exactly super comfortable.",
            "Perfect shirt for a summer wedding.  Dressy-ish, without being too formal.  Because it's a durable work shirt, it was a little stiff, but after washing with a lot of fabric softener, it feels much better.",
            "Excellent shirts, very comfortable, and made very well, but the sizing is pretty far off. I typically fit a 2XL in most brands very well, so that's what I ordered for these. Unfortunately, despite being my normal size, I swim in them. They're absolutely massive. It almost seems like a set of 3x or 4x shirts got the wrong tags. Having said that, I ordered this model shirt two each in three different colors, and the fit for all 6 was identical, so apparently it's just how they're made. They're made well and very comfortable, so I'd definitely recommend them, but make sure you go down a size or two from your normal.",
            "These are great. Nice, no-tuck, work shirts. No ironing necessary for the most part. Dark ones stay nice through many washes. Even white ones are more stain resistant that most. I don't care for the low, front tag on a no tuck shirt so I use a knife or seam ripper and remove them. The fit is also what I am looking for. I buy a 2X . Typically, shirts tend to run short on me. I find that if a shirt is going to shrink, its is most noticeable in the overall length of the shirt. These shirts don't appear to shrink or draw up in the washer or dryer."

They're a few dollars more than your typical budget tee from a chain retailer, but they hold their shape much better after repeated wears and washings. Also, they're a modern fit, not blousy like classic tees, but not so slim they're skin tight. They look and fit quite well. I just wish they had more colors. If they came out with a dark hunter green, a dark teal, and a charcoal gray, I'd order them immediately without a second thought.",
            "Well made. A very soft feel. As others have noted, the fit is a bit smaller than usual. I ordered a medium and would estimate that it is more like \"small-and-a-half,\" if that makes sense... I still would have given this 5 stars but the color is not as shown in the photos. What I received for the olive shirt is a much darker green. I also ordered the gray and it, too, is much darker. I wanted the much more faded look shown in the photos.

Not the end of the world, but I am also pretty gentle on my clothes when choosing wash/dry cycles. I'd still buy again because the fit and feel are so good, but I'll be interested to see if it is a fluke or a regular occurrence with these shirts.***Original review: I\u2019ve been trying to find a good t shirt to buy in bulk. American apparel is now gone and was too expensive for what it was, H&amp;M is wildly unpredictable size wise and cheap, next level apparel made shirts I loved but ordering them is a nightmare and I received a shirt that was a horrible polyester mix on my last attempt. SO I ordered one of these because I really liked the fit of their oxford shirts. For $12 I\u2019m going to buy five in white, black, and grey. Medium fits how I like (5 ft 11, 175lbs) and the fabric and finish is great. The pocket option is cool too.",
            "I\u2019m a bit picky with my T-shirt\u2019s. As a taller guy leaning on the chubby side, finding a good fitting T-shirt is difficult. Most I come across may be great in width but come extremely short in the length, or great in length but a bit narrower in the fit. These hit the perfect proportions for me. The fit and length are perfect. The cotton is also extremely high quality feeling compared to shirts around the same price point. I\u2019d go so far to say they feel like the premium line of Polo Ralph Lauren T\u2019s (but better fitting). The sleeves are perfect length and having put them through a few laundry cycles, the collar hasn\u2019t stretched out or started to curl.They\u2019re just really damn good shirts, and at $15 a pop, you can grab a few of them without breaking the bank."

            "I used to find these Beefy- tees in Walmart years ago. My husband needs the 2x. Then they stopped carrying them. One day, when my brain was working, I decided to peruse through Amazon. I couldn't believe my luck, when I found the Hanes Beefy tees. So I ordered 12. But you have to know: The ones I purchased at Wal-Mart 10 years ago, are still holding up, (barely). If you are married to a larger size man, or if YOU happen to be one, these are THE best quality t-shirts you'll ever find, or wear. They stand up to hundreds of washings, and the color seletion is superb. But the most important thing to us, is that they are 100% cotten. Best quality for your money.",
            "This shirt is very well made with a thick weave.  The color matches the picture even after repeated washings and there is no noticeable shrinkage even after tumble-drying on my dryer's highest setting.  I also tried applying iron-on transfers made for dark t-shirts to one of them and it worked beautifully.  I would recommend washing the shirt first, however, before trying to apply any iron-on transfer.",
            "I ordered a medium, which according to Haynes is for chests 38-40. My chest is exactly 40. When I tried the shirt on it was skin tight; so tight that I actually had some problems peeling it off. I then measured the shirt front just below the armpits and it was 19\" wide; times two is 38\". This explains why it was so tight for a 40 chest. As far as \"beefy\" was concerned, my opinion is that it's not. It's not thin, but neither is it heavy. Hanes used to sell a true \"beefy\" T, which I wore for probably 10 years, but a few years ago they cheapened the product.I had also been considering buying similar shirts from LL Bean or Land's End, but those cost 3 times as much; around $18 each, I decided to return the Hanes shirts and see what the much higher price of a LL Bean shirt would get me. When the shirts arrived I did some comparisons. The LL Bean shirt chest front measured 22\" (compared to 19\" for the Hanes) and it weighed 7.6  oz compared to 6.5 oz for the Haines; i.e. the LL Bean shirt was beefier than the Hanes, even though it was described as standard weight.Is it worth 3 times the price? Probably not. Just order one size up, don't expect a heavy weight shirt, and you'll probably be happy and definitely richer.",
            "I don\u2019t know why I just don\u2019t understand that you get what you pay for.I bought two of these, one Royal Blue and one Black.After washing and drying on a low setting, the overall shrinkage was minimal but as I suspected might happen, the bottom of the shirt folds up below the bottom seam. It is almost impossible to get it to fold back. Spraying a mist of water and adding a few clothes pins helps but that\u2019s just ridiculous.In addition to that, the seams where the sleeves are sewn to the body of the shirt are all puckered. It\u2019s impossible to flatten them, even ironing them.They are just plain old garbage and I should have paid double for one shirt...at least I would have had a wearable shirt instead of none.",
            "Junk!  These used to be like G.I. issue shirts long ago.  Now they include stretched out neck bands which get larger when washed!  I'm sorry I bought them, typical Asia made shirts with poor quality.  Seams were not uniform as well.  I've heard that the Costco shirts may be better.  Amazon did have a good price on these shirts, but I'm sorry that I purchased them.",
            "This is not \"beefy\" at all! I have a few Hanes Beefy T-shirts from a couple of years back and those are of the real quality: 100% cotton, no BS.The new t-shirt is 90% cotton + 10% polyester: you can see the daylight through the fabric. I's expect these to go through 4-5 wash cycles and become a rag. For the $6 it doesn't worth the trouble of returning it. But be aware.",
            "I keep coming back to buy more of these.  These are great work shirts and just general usage shirts and the only decent t-shirt with a pocket anymore.* Durability for cheap.  For $7 a shirt you get a fairly beefy cotton that doesn't rip the instant it catches on anything.  It holds up well in the wash.  The dye doesn't seem to fade.  I can't tell the difference between two year old and two month old shirts.* Pocket is nice.  It's big enough to stuff your phone into it, but its better suited to light items that won't fall out due to gravity if you bend forward and stuff that you can clip to the edge of the pocket.  Business cards, paper notes, pens, and small flashlights with pocket clips all do well in the pocket.  If you put a phone in it expect it to flop out on the concrete if you bend forward more than 45 degrees.* Consistency.  I've bought 8 of these so far, two at a time over the course of about two years as I replaced my other work t-shirts.  The sizing has not been altered in that time, nor has the material weight.  I can't even tell the difference between the shirts from two years ago and the most recent ones, they don't even seem to have worn.* Modest cut.  They lean toward the boxy side which is fine if you aren't trying to show off.  If you're a little on the pudgy side it's actually preferable.  When I first got these I was about 195 at 6'1\", two years later I've slimmed down while hitting the weights and sitting at 175 with a little more muscle in my upper torso and considerably less fat around my waist.  If you want to turn any heads or catch any eyes this is not your go to t-shirt.",
            "NOT TAGLESS. Pretty sure I got a knock off,  it has 2 cheap big tags. It is not \"beefy\" it is thin. Every other Hanes Beefy Tee(at least 5) I have bought are tagless with thick cotton. Will never buy from this seller again...\"Clothing Shop Online\"",
            "As much as I hate to tell you about these. I can't lie they are excellent quality shirts. They are thick well sewn and fit as expected. I can't believe the excellent price. Unfortunately the colors available are extrememly limited. I would definitely recommend.... but don't buy too many because they may run out before I order any more.",
            "After one washing in lukewarm water, the shirt which was extra-large became more like a large and was very tight on my shoulders and chest, I do not have a gut. My recommendation would be to tell prospective buyers that because you are selling a 100% pure cotton material which is not interwoven with any synthetic fabric, that some shrinkage should be anticipated, and suggest that they take a next size up. Just a suggestion ,I was in the dry cleaning and laundry business for 40 years. The quality and workmanship of the shirt in my opinion is excellent!  Mike Greco"

            "I was skeptical based on the price but pleasantly surprised once I opened the package. The shirts are comfortable, soft, thick(but not too thick) and great quality. I ordered the XL and the actual sizing was spot on. What I find hard to find in a good, quality T shirt is one where the sleeves are of normal length and the trunk of the T isn't too long or too short, and these fit the bill perfectly! Lastly, the fit is a \"standard\" fit, not that body hugging \"fitted\" crap that all shirts seem to be nowadays. For us guys with the \"Dad bods\", these shirts hang nicely and hide the guts, jelly rolls and man boobs that we've worked so hard to aquire over the years. I'll be buying plenty more of these shirts in the future! HIGHLY recommended.",
            "I usually buy white tshirts by Jockey for my husband as undershirts for his dress clothing, which he wears 5 days a week to work. Needless to say, we've used many brands over the years. I decided to try these this time I purchased his white tees based on the reviews and the price. I did go one size up from his usual size (Large) to an XLarge based on a few reviews regarding sizing. They fit perfectly. Not too big anywhere. They're not super tight around the neck like some under shirts can be, which drives my husband nuts. They are very soft right out of the packaging and haven't lost that softness with multiple times through the washer and dryer. I don't use fabric softener. I use wool balls as a natural fabric softener. So no chemical is being used to keep them soft. That's a plus for me because it means it's quality fabric.I actually purchased 3 white tshirts by Jockey at the same time I purchased these. I washed them all. Dried them all. Folded them all mixed together and placed them in a stack. I could see the difference. These are a bit thinner than the Jockeys. They aren't quite as white as Jockey. The sizing was nearly exactly the same as a Jockey Large. I wanted to see if my husband noticed a difference. He didn't!I've had these a few weeks now. They launder just fine. If there has been shrinkage it's been minimal and not noticeable. They still look brand new. Of course, in time I know they will wear out. All under shirts do when they are used as frequently as my husband must wear them. However, I'm pleased with them. My husband hasn't complained about them and trust me he WOULD complain if the shirts didn't feel right or fit correctly.I do think Jockey is a better quality overall, but I would buy these again. I do think they will break down sooner than the Jockey tees due to the thin material they're made of and the fact that these tshirts are worn, waged and dried A LOT. However, I would still recommend them. They are good quality and will last someone else a long time if they aren't been worn almost daily. This is a great deal for two quality white tshirts.**I would consider sizing up one size.**",
            "Finally a basic black tshirt in size medium that is long enough ! At 6' 2\" and 175lbs,  with a 33\" waist and 37\" chest, this tshirt has a few inches of free space in the chest and is fairly snug at the hips, which is fine given most of my other mediums (other brands) are a bit too short on me. Material is soft. Will wrinkle if you dont take it out of dryer asap but thats on me not the shirt. Recommend !",
            "I like these t shirts quite a bit, enough that I bought eight of them so far. The material is just the right thickness - it's definitely a t shirt, not an undershirt, though it will serve both purposes. I bought the XL and found they fit really well and have held up to multiple washings. Since I'm in a part of the country where t shirt weather can be year-round, these get a lot of wear. My only concern is it seems like the selection has dramatically decreased to the point I'm thinking Amazon has discontinued them. I hope that's not the case as these are quality shirts at a good price.",
            "The t-shirt is very nice quality. But the size is too big. I brought the medium size and it is more than 4-6 inches bigger than the comparable medium t-shirt from other brands. The medium t-shirt I got was about 44 inches chest size, which is XL as per the sizing chart.",
            "Already bought 2 sets, so I have 4 of these t-shirts in my closet now.Excellent cotton quality, excellent sewing quality.Great for wearing in and outdoors.Watch out regarding the size selection though, I would order one size below your normal t-shirt size. I ordered Small, and absolutely love the size.I am 5'10\", 175lb who usually wear Medium t-shirts in order to enjoy \"the right fit.\"To wrap up, I am definitely willing to purchase more and try other colors in the future.",
            "Next time I will order a large rather than an XL. I'd rather wear a shirt a little too big than one that's too small. I think large would be just right. I love the softness of the cotton, and the color is beautiful. I've never bought a t-shirt of this quality for under $30.",
            "Review after 1 wash.Size Large/Color BlueFor comparison I\u2019m 215lbs 38\u201d waist.Some shrinkage but overall held up very well.  I like the length of the shirt, hangs below the belt.On me it reaches the bottom of the fly on my jeans.No noticeable color fade.I ordered 2 more in red!",
            "I was skeptical about buying amazon clothes but these are honestly great t shirts. Five stars.",
            "one wash and stitching unraveled. yes I followed the care instructions. the material feels right, but is extremely light. I doubt i'll trust another AmazonEssentials garment again."

            "Fit on these is just as expected and the material is slightly heavier than the short sleeve version. Had to knock a couple stars off for a bad sew job on the cuffs of two out of the four in the package. The sleeve must not have been straight when the cuff was sewn and it created a permanent \u201ctwist\u201d on the cuff that impossible to remove even with an iron and heavy starch job. Kinda drives me batty enough that I\u2019ll probably end up cutting off the long sleeves. A shame to pay a premium for the long sleeve and have to cut them off.",
            "The product came in a generic clear bag, well packaged with some sort of product identification label, but not Hanes packaging.The product description is for medium weight, the product label says heavy weight.The product description is for Comfort Soft, the product label says Comfort Soft, but the cotton is the normal non-soft cotton. I have retail Comfort Soft and these are not that at all.The product description at the bottom of the web page has a comparison table, and it shows the heavyweight are no supposed to be Comfort Soft.So...it appears this is a knock-off product. Based on other reviews on the cheap quality I did not even try washing, I returned them. I'd rather have the real product.",
            "As most of the reviews have noted, there is some looseness in the arms. However, the pack I received after the first wash on gentle there was a tear in the right armpit of all four. Bad quality control. The fabric is nice, typical Hanes tshirt. If it weren't for the tears I would have gladly given this product the full five stars.",
            "In the winter I wear long sleeved T-Shirts with pajama bottoms at night and in the evening and into the next morning with my jeans. These are exactly what I was looking for. They are medium weight, and very comfortable (Hanes T-Shirts are tag-less). And buying these in the 4-pack is a little cheaper than buying them individually. The royal blue is a very nice shade (I like blue) and has shown no tendency to fade.Like most Hanes T-shirts these run just slightly small so I order a 3X instead of a 2X.",
            "The weight is good/heavy. The cut doesn't fit at all like the long sleeve shirts I bought in a department store. The collar is wider, the shoulder width is off by ~1\" on each shoulder, and to describe the material ad \"Comfortsoft\" is laughable. They ride my neck like a t-shirt put on backwards. I have owned dozens of t-shirts by Hanes. These don't measure up, literally or figuratively, to the Hanes brand.",
            "Good deal for 4 shirts. Using as pajama shirts, so the loose fit is great. I got XL to be sure they would still be comfortable if they shrink.  I have washed a few times and they don't seem to shrink as much as some reviewers experienced. Probably could have gone with a Large as the fit is boxy. If you just want a decent quality plain shirt and you aren't trying to make a fashion statement (using for a work shirt or sleep shirt for example), these are a good buy. The cuff does not fit tight either. Quality is fine for my use; soft and comfortable.",
            "NOT 100% COTTON. Shirts I received are 90% cotton and 10% polyester.  My husband is allergic to polyester in any amount. Sent back without trying them on.",
            "I got these shirts to use during summer yard work to keep sun off my arms. I wanted white cotton t-shirt material for it's breathability, and low price so that if a shirt got trashed in the process it wasn't a big deal or I could die it if I really needed to.Not much else to it, these are long sleeve white t shirts, so if you like wearing white t shirts, just imagine the sleeves being extended and there you have it! White is also good for summer yard work since it reflects the sun light. They also do okay and blocking the thorns and branches although it isn't the most durable material. I feel certain I will get more than my moneys worth from these as I tend to keep my white t shirts for many years until they practically disintegrate.",
            "Though I wish that they were additionally offered as a combination of colors in one package I am very happy with this purchase. This is very durable material and much thicker than a standard t-shirt. I normally don't wear a snug t-shirt but I like the feel of this cotton. I absolutely recommend that you get a size larger if you don't like a tapered feel because they do shrink a bit when you wash them and naturally I suggest you doing that first BEFORE you wear them.",
            "The neck is insanely squiggly. They are also VERY short shirts. I am just 5 feet 6 inches tall and the medium shirts were way too short, lifting my hands a tiny bit reveals my belly button. These shirts SUCK. I recommend Fruit of the Loom, they don't have trash neck."

            "i use to like these t-shirts untell they went to 100% cotton. I use to wear a xL tall but now wear a 2xL tall. They use to last 6 months before they shrink too much but now since there 100% cotton they last about 1 month before they shrink too much to wear. The photo i uploaded shows a 2x Tall washed about a month over a 2x Tall new,  you can see there is a good 3 inches shrunk,and i wash in cold and hang dry my T-shirts also so its not the dryer shrinking them.i dont know why they advertise preshrunk becouse clearly they are not. You might as well just by hanes normal T's at wal mart and save the money because there about the same size after a couple of washes. Right now im trying jerzees white tees, but if any one knows of a good plain white tee that isnt 100% cotton please respond or write a review because hanes beefy T is just an over priced hanes normal T ever since they went to 100% cotton.",
            "My husband is a bigger man and he likes his shirts to be long. This shirt is how long one should be when called a tall size. If you are looking for longer shirts, try these. My husband loves them and we will be ordering more colors. Its just a regular tee shirt but the perfect length for the taller guys out there. highly recommend!",
            "It has been a very long time since I have worn a Beefy-T.  For several years I used Hanse Premium, which did great the first few years, but it seems that something must have changed over the past couple of years, because they seem to have lost the quality that they once had, shrinking in length too much.  I then tried two different types of Jockey.  Again, some seemed to be dependable, while others shrunk way too much.  So, in my search for a tee that would be long enough I stumbled across these again.  I am 6'2'' and about 245.  I do like my tees on the long side...so that they stay tucked in.  I purchased XLT...the \"T\" meaning \"Tall\" so that I would have the extra length.Pros:-After several washes, they have pretty much maintained their length.  They stay tucked in.-Very durable.Cons:-I have not found any yet.Note:  These are thicker than normal tees.  So, if you want something thin, this is not the tee for you.  If you want something of good, durable quality, then this is the tee for you.Would I purchase these again?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, I have placed a couple of more orders since these first two orders.",
            "I ordered size 3XLT. I have many 3XLT t-shirts and know that is the right size for me. This shirt is for a very slim big guy. I can get it around me and I have a little room, but it feels restrictive and the fabric will probably shrink even more. It is also extremely long, even for a tall size. This shirt, in size 3XLT, is probably perfect for someone around 6'8\" and around 220 lbs.",
            "This 2 pack was a great value. I'm a female 5'6\" and use these cotton T-shirts as night shirts. Even after washing and drying them they still come down to about an inch or 2 above my knee caps. Perfect !",
            "I have ordered these shirts many times before and wear them quite often, they fit well and feel really comfortable. Ordered two more of the same product as before and they are not the same shirt. Not only do they not fit, the feel of the fabric and shape of the shirt is very wrong. Also with the poor quality Ive noticed the label on the inside is not the same as the other shirts so this leads to believe this is a knock off.",
            "I should write that \"fit as expected' is \"fit as hoped and prayed for\" because trying to find t-shirts for this particular person has been a challenge. But these Hanes Men's Tall Short-Sleeve Beefy T-Shirt are exactly what he needed. It fits in the shoulders and back but also in length. Length has been the biggest challenge as most t-shirts are too short but these hit right where he likes them. We have more on order. That's how much he likes them.",
            "During the summer, I prefer to wear oversize t-shirts around the house, so a few weeks ago I went on an Internet quest to find the perfect ones. I first bought a different brand, and was unhappy with the flimsy fabric, so I ordered these. Boy, am I glad I did! The fit and the fabric are perfect. These will hold up after many washings, unlike the thin fabric of the other brand. These cost a bit more, but they were well worth it.",
            "The blue shirts fit nicely and are made of a nice, thick material. But the seams where the underarm meets the body of the shirt are weak. After only one washing they started to split open, and now I have holes directly where my underarms are. This happened to both of the blue shirts I received. I've also ordered black shirts in the past and this happened to them as well. However, this does not seem to be a problem with the white or gray shirts, which I ordered at the same time as these blue ones and have not shown any signs of splitting. They seem to be made of a thinner material as well. My guess would be that the more heavily dyed shirts use a thicker material and cheaper sewing around certain areas. If having holes that show your armpits doesn't bother you, then these shirts will be perfect for you.",
            "Good weight/quality.  Fit as expected, just right, cut appropriately.  Comfortable t-shirts, thicker than the typical Hanes or Fruit of the Loom.NOTE:  If you appreciated this review please give it a \u201cthumbs up/like\u201d your helping me to continue to give honest/unbiased insight into products I\u2019ve used and you may have questions about.

            "It's very long in the body, and doesn't really have a slim fit like most baseball tees.  I've got a long torso and it's still too long for me, but I'm ok with that because I like knowing my shirt slightly covers my rump. Because I've got some curve, it makes me look rather boxy. The colors are nice though, so I'm hoping I can shrink it in the wash and stretch it in places to fit better. I'm 5'7\", 142lbs, with a slightly curvy/athletic build. The arms are big enough to house my muscles, which gives it a leg up on most women's shirts. It doesn't look cheaply made, so that's another plus. If you want a good pajama shirt or you like boys clothes, this will be great for you. If you have muscular arms and a longer torso, this will be great for you. If you want it to hug your body like it does on the male models or customers who sent in pics... You might want to pass this up.",
            "Love It. Fits like I wanted. I'm 5'11'' 180lbs and I normally where a medium or a large, I got this in a large and it \"fits\" me like I want. Wife loves it too",
            "Original: Trust me these shirts are worth it. I go to sites that sell shirts like this for $30-$50 just for this kind of quality. The softness from the polyester and cotton blend is what makes this shirt worth it. I just had to get rid of all my 100% cotton shirts because they felt too rough after I started wearing these. Not even my favorite brand store have this type of quality. I at least expected Hollister or Abercrombie to match this but even if they do They charge 3 times the price (on clearance too). I recommend this shirt brand too everyone. Just make sure to get 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The blend makes a huge difference. Not 50/50, Not 70/30, a true 60/40 is the one you want. Oh I almost forgot they even gave me a discount off my next purchase and I just started buying from them. Well Guess I'll starting buying from them now. See ya Later everyone.Edit 1. Where Do I even start. I was once so proud to be a customer for this seller but now I don't know what I'm getting. I just placed an order for the exact same shirt (size, color, and quantity). I was sure they would just send another shirt my way and I just pay for it like I regularly do on Amazon. I was glad to have been able to receive a quality shirt at first but now I just received something I can't even tell. They sent me not a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt but a Shaka Active shirt which is 100% cotton. The difference in the blend is very big too me. I like my 60/40 blend because of how soft the fabric is and how much more comfort I get wearing it. The brand Dream USA makes wonderful quality shirts and I admire their products. But for the Shaka Active shirt I receive was awful. Smells strange, and I don't even know why they sent me such a hippo-size shirt. I ordered a small. fabric was rough and poorly made; nothing compare to the 60% cotton / 40% polyester one I order 2 days ago. I just don't understand why they sent me this. Was it a mistake or a mix-up? Or perhaps they are trying to get rid of past inventory of Shaka Active shirts? All I want right now is just a replacement. I'll even take a different color (size: small [60% cotton / 40% polyester]).  I will buy again only if they truly do have a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt. I do not want to buy any more lies. Please I really want to buy more shirts. Here are some photos, The shirts may look alike but the texture is very different. First set is Shaka (100%) and Second set is A Real Dream USA shirt (60% cotton / 40% polyester) I'm repeating this a lot is because I do not want anymore 100% cotton shirts.Edit 2: Okay Okay You got me. So, as I was writing this review, it turns out they listen to me then sent me a replacement on the same day. I got my new shirt and it was a Dream USA shirt. I am confident now to start buying again. I just hope this does not happen again. I am also sorry to have said anything negative. You guys working in customer service, delivery, and manufacturing have done a wonderful job. I am more than satisfied and will be buying more shirts. In fact I'll be buying 2 more shirts right now. Thank you so much for your hard work.",
            "Very soft, thin fabric with athletic fit.  I\u2019m  6\u20193 and 180lbs and normally wear a L and sometimes an XL.  Ordered XL due to warnings that shirt runs small. It fits but is just a bit tight (but wearable). Ordered a 2XL and it\u2019s perfect. I\u2019d say you need to buy 2 sizes larger than normal,  Shirt is very comfy and I like the thin fabric. This is a benefit for me, not a criticism. I hate the heavy 100% cotton shirts. That said, BE WARNED  that other colors of this shirt  have a \u201cShaka\u201d label rather than the \u201cDream\u201d label.  The Shaka shirts are 100 thick cotton and run big. Basically, there\u2019s two different manufacturers and fabrics of the shirts offered here. Color dictates whether it\u2019s a Dream shirt or Shaka shirt.  Don\u2019t like the Shaka - way too big, ill fitting and heavy cotton",

Why change it if it works?\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff",
            "I've purchased this shirt in almost every color offered (sometimes 2-3 of the same one). I really hate the heat, and even in the winter I'm trying to wear as little clothing as possible to stay cool.These t-shirts have become a staple for me. They're great for any casual setting, very lightweight, and they hold up remarkably well after several washes. No color fading, no rips or tears in any of mine yet (I must own around ~20 by now). I only buy a few duplicates of my favorites because I'm liable to get oil stains on any and all pieces of clothing I own for some reason.Anyway, highly recommend these - they fit great around the arms, the V isn't too deep, and they aren't overly long (I'm 5'7\" and they taper off perfectly around pockets on most of my pants). They also fit a bit snugly toward the bottom - doesn't look like a loose tshirt hanging all over the place.Size wise they're what you'd expect. I'm typically a medium (5'7\", small frame, 155lb) and these fit great in medium. Large would definitely be too loose on me whereas medium is form-fitting.",
            "Love this tee. I have to wear undershirts to work, and I've had a hard time consistently finding comfortable shirts with a good cotton-poly blend. All-cotton shirts always end up with stretched out necks, looking saggy, etc. These shirts are absolutely perfect. They are silky-smooth to the touch, absolutely comfortable even when I'm sweating, they still wick moisture well and dry quickly. They came through the wash with minimal shrinking. There are small tags in the neck, which initially upset me, but as I went to cut them out, they pull out with minimal tension, almost as if they're stuck on with velcro instead of sewn. I was able to get them off without damaging the neck seam in any way. Would have been upset about the itchy neck tag, but it came off with no issue.In summary, you may find a cheaper multi-pack from a larger brand, but you will absolutely not find a better white tee shirt. If you are an everyday undershirt wearer like me, these are the shirt to get. I ordered 2 to see how they fit and I ordered another 4 literally minutes after taking these out of the box. Just the touch of the fabric was enough to convince me.",
            "Perfect fit. I bought this for my friend. He likes shirts form fitted and not long. This was perfect. And really soft. He's 6 feet tall and apx 200 lbs",
            "Extremely tight and small it fits like an extra extra small probably would. I have other Next Level shirts in small which fit me perfectly, not tight at all.The V-Neck is also so large it goes down past my chest. This shirt fits horribly and they don't do returns so I'm SOL. I'm guessing they shipped a women's shirt, since it looks nothing like what others have posted. I'll change my review if they make up for it.",
            "These shirts are amazing!  First off, they fit well, and cover everything.  I'm a 6'4\" guy and about 200 lbs.  They are incredibly soft, very durable in the wash. I don't get hot and sweaty in them as much as other T-shirts.  I wear these under my hospital scrub tops since the hospital is cold, but when I have to work hard with overweight patients these keeps me from melting to death.  I love wearing them for casual clothing as well, and so I've decided to order much more from the next level brand.  They are a hidden gem, and very inexpensive for such a product, I think.",
            "I love these shirts, they are soft and hold up well after washings with no color fade or shrinking. The sleeves are not too short which is my biggest complaint about most tees that I buy. Will definitely be purchasing again."

            "I got these shirts for my dad. Love him to death but he has a bit of a sweating problem that needed some serious attention :) haha. He works as a doctor so he wears dress shirts a lot of the time when he's seeing patients throughout the day. He's always worn an undershirt when he's working, and not working, but with those dress shirts, especially on warmer days in an office you tend to sweat and sweat tends to soak through your clothes and is then visible. He use to wear the regular cotton material undershirts but those would just end up getting wet and yucky by the end of the day, so I did some research for him and found these!!! They work amazing and he loves them. He says they're extremely lightweight and comfortable and unlike his other undershirts, when he sweats he doesn't feel the wetness of the sweaty shirt on his body all day. He doesn't even notice this undershirt is there! And the nicest part about the shirts is that they keep there nice pure white color! Even if you do mix your laundry load with colors and darks these will stay white and look nice under thinner/light color shirts! I ordered a large for him and that fit him perfectly. He was also a large in the regular undershirts!",
            "I've used Hanes shirts for a base layer under my dress clothing for some time, but had traditionally used the cotton shirts only.  After reading up on cotton and the comparison to polyester fabrics, I found that while cotton will soak up sweat, it does not dry quickly, and holds the moisture next to your body, causing all kinds of issues.Instead, these shirts are the \"dri fit\" type of fabric - soft to the touch, comfortable, and most importantly, they pull sweat away from the body and help it to rapidly evaporate.I have worn these shirts under dress clothes with positive results, but also tested them by wearing them as a base layer when out hiking and working up a sweat.  These shirts stayed comfortable, and I stayed pretty dry even though I was sweating.  I highly recommend these shirts, and have already bought more for myself.",
            "I ordered an adult small for my 5ft 100lb daughter to wear for a soccer try out. I had asked on here if the shirt fit more like a tshirt or like an undershirt. I can say it fits more like a tshirt. It was just right for what we needed.",
            "These great Hanes shirts fit true to American sizes if not just a very small \"over\" and they wear extremely cool and breath so well that a really hot day is not so bad at all. Hanes hit a homer with these and I have now ordered three colors in packs of two. The very, very low prices for the packs of two cannot be beaten and you can even mix and match the colors but watch your pricing as some combinations ARE NOT Amazon Prime and have higher prices with freight charged. The care is as simple as throwing them into the cold wash with similar colors. Hang on hangers and air dry or they can be dried on low heat and takes less than ten minutes on medium.  toss into the wash with any type clothes.One of the best values I have found on Amazon. Buy them. No regrets!",
            "These are wonderful Tee shirts. They have a quality fit and finish that would be admirable for an outer garment. Their smooth, classy look and feel are entirely different than that of an ordinary cotton Tee shirt. Originally, I bought them for a trip planning to wash and dry them myself in my hotel room and let them dry overnight. That worked out very well. Now, I launder them with my dress shirts. They come out looking brand new after each wash.",
            "I work in a very hot environment and cotton shirts get soaked and stay wet in 5 minutes.  This shirt stays dry and it feels like I've got a tiny brezeze cooling me under the shirt all day as I work.  It doesn't stop you from staying wet and sweaty but it's much better than anything else I've tried.  Can't say about longevity but quality is good and I expect them to last.  I wish they were a little smaller- I got the normal Large size and do wonder if a Medium would fit better.  I don't care for an over sized under-shirt",
            "I thought these felt plasticy when i first tried them out but stopped noticing it after 2 days of wearing these to work. Much better than cotton for keeping cool. The shirt will still get pretty moist if youre producing a lot of sweat but does not become an oven when it does. Dries out much faster than cotton once you greet a chance to rest.  Shirts did not shrink after the first wash. Have a glossy shine to them vs cotton.Hanes has these for a better deal on their site, more colors, and you don't have to buy 2 packs for the better price. You just have to be willing to accept standard shipping vs prime. Ordered 11 to add to the 2 i already have.",
            "I'm a size medium for all of my shirts (including other Hanes brand shirts), but in these shirts I'm a size small. The mediums were very large and baggy on me and fit like a large normally would. I'm 5'9\" 165lbs. I wear these under my bulletproof vest at work every day during the summer and they do a far better job wicking the moisture away compared to cotton t-shirts. They keep me cool and comfortable for 8+ hours a day, and don't cut into my arm pits like the UA heat gear shirts I bought for ten times the price. All in all was a great purchase, and I would buy again.",
            "At only $14 for two red shirts, I wasn't expecting too much. Wicking shirts are hit and miss even when you buy them at a sports store. But when I got the shirts, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the material and attention to detail. The shirts fit just right and the price is right. Granted, I would have preferred to have a red shirt along with another color, but those options were like $29 so that wasn't going to happen.In any case, the Hanes Short Sleeve Cool DRI T-Shirt is a quality shirt and performs well out on the trail. I have included a photo of it on the trail when you can see so long as Amazon doesn't strip the photo out. If they do, I will probably be writing a gear review for this shirt on my dayhikingtrails.com blog. Cheers!",
            "I have purchased multiple colors of these shirts and absolutely love them. From around the house to working in the yard. They keep you cool. All the other colors I purchased were great until I purchased these. They have a bug spray smell that I cannot seem to wash out. I\u2019ve laundered them multiple times and once I put these on I can smell bug spray. All the other colors white, navy blue, grey, white, and black don\u2019t have the smell. All are the same size and brand but these just flat out stink and are all but unwearable. That being said these by far are the most comfortable and cool shirts I own hints why I purchased multiple colors. If you want to be cool and comfortable these are perfect. Even in direct sunlight you will not sweat. I have mowed the yard in the sun and remained cool. Just flat out awesome."

            "About me:  Adult male office worker.  I take showers at least once per day and use deodorant.  TMI?  Well, just keep reading...I purchased three\u00a0PGA TOUR Golf Air Flux Short-Sleeve Solid Polo Shirt, Caviar, X-Large\u00a0and three\u00a0Hanes Men's X-Temp Performance Polo, Black, XX-Large\u00a0on the same day.  I did this because I wanted to compare the two shirts.Both fit well.  Both seem to be of good construction and quality fabric.There is, however, one major difference:  The PGA TOUR shirts have accumulated a STINK over the past few months. The 100% polyester PGA shirts now have \"an odor\" whereas the 90% cotton/10% polyester Hanes shirts do not.How am I doing laundry?  I throw them into the washing machine and then into the dryer.  Yes, I know, I've checked the internet and found out that I can de-stinkify polyester shirts through a simple process of soaking them for a few hours in a mixture of hot water, vinegar, and Listerine mouthwash.  It really does work...temporarily.  Thing is, I just want to do my laundry and not make an all-day affair out of it.CONCLUSION:  My experiment was a success.  I will purchase more of the Hanes and will NOT purchase any more of the PGAs.",
            "I read the reviews first and decided i would give it a try.I bought this product for my husband. These shirts are excellent, I only ordered one to see first what it was like,  the material is nice and soft (60% Cotton and 40% polyester). I washed it a few times and it hasn't faded or shrank, it still looks like new. I will definitely be ordering more in different colours for him. My husband loves it.It fitted as expected, I bought the blue, its a nice colour, added a picture for you to see. It does look like the picture they show.Very good quality for the money.The product came on time.",
            "These polos are fantastic. They are soft, breathable, and wash and dry wonderfully. We have purchased two white and one black in the XXXL size and they have been washed an worn many times. Fit is consistent between colors and these are nice and long. The collar also does not curl up after drying and we haven't noticed any significant fading on the black polo after at least 12 washes with like colors. I don't feel like they shrunk at all either. We will be getting more of these in the future.",
            "First reaction: soft!Second reaction: kinda big!After reading the reviews complaining about it being \"too small\", I thought I'd play it safe and order a size up. I'm 5'11\", 180 lb (180 cm and 80 kg for everyone else in the world) and I'm on the thicker side-- I go to the gym 5 days a week, but I also eat ice cream 7 days a week, so I'm sure it adds up.I tried it on as soon as I got it and it's definitely on the larger side/fits like a \"regular large\" would fit on me. I own mostly medium shirts, so I know what a large feels like. It does feel on the longer side, but I expect it to shrink some since most of the reviews say that as well. I'm using this polo shirt as a Halloween costume, so I won't go through the simple (but still kind of arduous) process of returning and purchasing a better-fitting size.In my honest opinion, I don't think it makes me look fat, although a bit baggy at the armpit areas. I do adjust the bottom when reaching into my pockets, but that doesn't bother me very much. Since the shirt is so darn soft, I'll probably use it to sleep/lounge when I want to relax but also have a collar-- which, by the way, is definitely on the larger side for those of you that like a snug collar. Thankfully, the relaxed fit of the shirt sags the collar and doesn't make me look too much like a turtle.The material breathes okay, but nothing like Nike or other dedicated athletic wear. It'll probably get a little hot in the sun, but it won't be like wearing a trash bag. Overall, it seems like a solid shirt! If I need to buy another, I'll definitely come back, but I'll probably order my usual size instead of sizing up.",
            "This has become my new work shirt. We have to wear either black or white at work and with me being a bigger guy.....solid white just doesn't look great on me. The shirt breathes well in the summer. I live in SW Arizona and it consistently hits 108+ degrees in the summertime. So having a shirt that can breathe helps out a ton. I still sweat in it, but I can cool off quickly once indoors.The one thing I have noticed is that over time the shirt has become a duller black. Yes the shirt is black, but it's more of a dark black not pure black as when I first bought it. My only guess to that is because the dye is fading over the every other day washes.",
            "These are not high quality polo shirts. They are basically an incognito Hanes X-Temp t-shirt disguised as a polo shirt. In the right environment, they're awesome! I bought one to check sizing and decided to watch the prices and buy more when the price fluctuates cheaper than usual. So far, I've bought the Neon Blue and the Neon Yellow. Both are bright, vibrant colors that pop.Sizing: I have (in actual tape measured inches) a 42 inch chest, 36 inch waist, and 14 inch unflexed  biceps. Mediums in this shirt fit me nicely.",
            "Way better than expected for price. Added logo for work shirt",
            "As I expected, this shirt went beyond my expectations. It has been worn and washed multiple times and it has retained its shape and color.  Often with other clothing with a red color, the color fades or bleeds. Not so with this shirt.  I have enjoyed wearing it and I receive compliments on it.  The fabric is soft which makes it comfortable to wear often.  It is casual and yet, it is dressy for going out. The sleeve length and the length of the shirt are perfect. The collar has a slight stiffness to enable it to retain its shape although it is extremely comfortable. The buttons are attached well and fit well in the button holes.Hanes has a reputation of manufacturing great products and it is evident in this product and others I have used. I highly recommend this shirt and this manufacturer.  I will definitely buy this brand again and I look forward to purchasing the variety of colors it comes in.  The product arrived quickly and in great condition.  I regularly purchase from Amazon because of the consistent products I can get.",
            "I bought these shirts in 4 different colors (black, navy, royal blue, and light steel) since I usually wear polos when I'm on-site for client visits.  Figured I'd give these a shot for some of the more casual offices.  For the price they are a great value.  I just wish the quality was a little higher.  On every single shirt I've had to tie off and cut the stitching under the arms.  I'm not sure if this is just excess stitching that comes loose after a few uses and washes, or what.  No holes have opened up, so I'm hoping that's the case.  It's just a bit worrisome when you've worn the shirt 5 times and have to cut foot long strings out of the armpit.But... they're cheap to replace and look good enough that it's not a big thing.  I'll probably buy some more when these get ragged.  On the good side they fit well and the fabric doesn't pill like some other shirts I've had.",

            "Not really seller's fault, but the hem stitching did NOT have a bobbin thread.  Therefore, after the first wash, the top threads came out and it looks like crap, with the hem all rolled up instead of having a crisp fold (i.e. the entire point of having a hem).  Considering this product was made in Nicaragua, in some slave labor sweat shop where quota is all that matters, not too surprising, but disappointing.  I don't expect the seller to inspect every item they sell, but this can't be the first time poor quality reared its ugly head.Shirts are soft, as described, but the poor quality of the stitching makes me not like this product as much as I would otherwise.",
            "Decent shirts, I think they are more of a \"Euro fit\". I am usually a medium, but the mediums here have a tight fit in the upper body. If you have broad shoulders or thick biceps I would recommend ordering a size up.",
            "Super soft and very comfy! I bought XL since it's 100% cotton. Washed and dried and it shrunk a little bit like expected but fits nice.Updated 5/25/17I went down to 4 stars because I found a hole in one of the T-shirts and it wasn't even worn yet.",
            "I bought two different color sets from this company and the colors don't look much like they do in the pictures shown in either set, I bought the 'earth tone' pack and the shirts don't look so \"heathery\" at all, and two of the colors look almost identical in person... the fit is super nice and lightweight (nice for the summer) so that's why i'm deciding to keepall in all very decent product but kind of misleading....",
            "I bought these for my husband because I want him to graduate from graphic tees to adult tees. They are constructed so well and buttery soft. I love love love the colors and they didn\u2019t shrink on first wash. I will be purchasing these again and I look forward to trying a different color choice.",
            "These shirts are a little thinner than I was looking for. They fit OK but being as thin as they are, I wonder if they will hold up...Colors were also  a little off from what I expected, but that could be because of my laptop screen coloration.  The violet color is especially lighter than pictured.  I was really looking for something like the Costco Peru shirts in other colors.",
            "Pretty good as basic shirts go. They cover all the important bits, the material feels nice, and the stitches seem to be strong and good quality. I've washed them about 20 times now, and they haven't shrunk much in the torso region. The arms, however, seem to shrink a little more than the rest of the shirt. Still, for cheap shirts to wear hiking and camping I'd say they work really well. I like the earth tone color pack. I bought the large. At 6', 195lbs they fit a little tight around the shoulders and arms (I'm not a body builder or anything, but I do have fairly broad shoulders).",
            "Size M ordered, I'm about a little over six foot and fluctuate between 165-175lbs. They fit slim and right. Perfect length as well. Already ordered an additional set in different colors.",

But also want ones that are attractive enough to be seen as shirts.These fill that bill.  They're attractive.  And they're fitted.  But not too fitted.  In other words, they don't look like your wearing your younger brother's t-shirts.And I love the military colors.  You will too.I took off one star because quality control could be a bit better.  I've bought three packages of these shirts.  And some had suspect stitching that required some quick mending.  If not for that problem this would be a five star product.",
            "Shirts fit well, I'm 6'2\" and 195 and ordered a large, plenty long enough which is typically my problem. The chest area is snug (not tight, but comparatively) with room in the sleeves so you can move easily. Even after a wash there was only minimal shrinkage from the original size.The colors match what I was expecting from the pictures as well, fairly spot on. They are light weight, without being see through, I have worn them out to casual dinners with nice jeans, run in them with no concerns, and routinely use them to sleep in."

            "Terrible product, I would highly recommend avoiding these T-shirts. I have bought Hanes ComfortSoft shirts before, and what I received are definitely not them.The ComfortSoft shirts are supposed to be tagless so that the collar is not irritating in any way, with the Hanes logo/material/size printed on the fabric directly. The shirts I received had the shirt material and size printed on the cotton, but the Hanes logo was on a tag sewn into the collar....The picture shows shirts without a tag......The section from the manufacturer says \"All the comfort of Hanes with our famous tag-free collar,\"...BUT, the description that Amazon listed says \"White neck tag easily removed for tag-free comfort,\" yet the tag is sewn into the collar. So, clearly, these are not the ComfortSoft shirts, so both the picture and the manufacturer's description are not relevant to what Amazon ships out. Oh, and how is this tag easily removed? Well, I could cut it off and leave a short, sharp, scratchy protrusion of tag sticking out of the collar, or I could rip the stitching, remove the tag, and then re-sew it back together. \"Easily removed?\" Definitely not.The only thing that deserves any credit is that the sizing was as expected, a Medium. But that's before washing, and I'm not keeping them long enough to find out. Highly disappointed in Amazon, and I set about returning my order within 5 minutes of receiving it.",
            "There's no way these shirts are 90% cotton. The fabric (whatever it is) has quite an abrasive quality to it, and the actual fit is odd in that it makes no difference which way you put it on; the shirt feels the same around the neck and sleeves, even when worn backwards. Probably the worst pack of shirts i've ever owned. Would not recommend.",
            "I almost didn't buy these because of one of the more critical reviews.  I can see where there might be a batch that were not made as well as others.  However, the 6 I got were just fine.  No workmanship flaws that I can find.  My wife immediately washed them and dried them in the normal manner to make sure they would hold their, as much as possible, their size and shape.  I ordered XL to make sure that shrinkage would keep them wearable and that was accomplished.  I like these shirts, they are not too heavy nor too light weight - just about right for me.  And, for the price, I think it was a great deal and outstanding value.",
            "I learned the hard way that \"Comfortsoft\" is simply a name, it's NOT a description - this is what earns a 1-star. In addtion to that, I made a mistake in branding. I order the \"Hanes's Nano Premium\" shirts and LOVED THEM- they are very soft and comfortable - so I came back to order more soft and comfortable shirts and I saw this deal has 5 in the pack (the other only has two, so i have to order two and only get 4 in the order) but this package of 5, I stand to get a 5th shirt for only two more dollars! - It was all good until  I received the order in the mail and these shirts are VERY rough and scratchy. So the lesson is just order the Nano Premium shirts - and \"so what\" I have to add more orders of the Nano Premium shirts to the shopping cart, there is no real cost savings by ordering this package of cheap scratchy shirts.

But like I said he likes them roomy and we wanted to plan for shrinkage and these will shrink! Hopefully not more than what we planned for. If they shrink more than we expected I'll update my review.Item arrived in 2 days as expected and packaged well."

            "I ordered a two-pack of these Slim Fit t-shirts and a two-pack of the Regular Fit t-shirts to compare and contrast. Both styles are made of the same thick cotton knit fabric, which is soft and substantial, but the fits are definitely different. These Slim Fit shirts are significantly tighter fitting in the stomach, arms, and chest area(s). The Regular Fit shirts are much looser in all three of these areas, especially the arms.Compared to a Regular Fit I would categorize these as a Slim Fit not, a Snug Fit; they fit close to the body but not tightly enough to show something like muscle definition, if that's what you're looking for.For comparison, I would say that these  Amazon Essentials Slim Fit t-shirts are tighter fitting than a standard Gap or Old Navy t-shirt fit but looser fitting than a standard American Apparel or H&amp;M t-shirt fit.Overall the quality is nice, with minimal fading and only very minor shrinkage after laundering in cold water and putting in a medium dryer.

            "You can't go wrong with these.  The fabric is soft and the sleeves and torso seem to have a little more intentional length added to them--both plusses in my book for a casual t-shirt.  I ordered a medium and, with about a 16.5'' neck, the rim of the collar comes right up to my neckline--fine for me but might perhaps be a potential warning for guys who are a little more husky or athletic.  I personally love them and will be buying again.",
            "To loosely quote Mitch Hedberg, \"The shirt feels like a really weak man is choking you\".My biggest complaint is the neck.  It's so small and uncomfortably tight on your neck.

J Crew never has the medium talls in stock any longer and they are thin and poor quality anyway, so took a chance on these.They fit PERFECTLY and feel like they are quality - the material is about twice as thick as the J Crew shirts but it's still very soft/comfortable.",

These Amazon Essentials t-shirts are perfect, so much better than the Hanes t-shirts! The material is soft. It doesn't fade or shrink in the wash, and I wash my clothes in hot water and use the dryer on high. The color is vibrant. The cut is maybe slightly longer than usual, but it's a minor con. Perfect!"

The color of the buttons were brighter than I expected (but honestly I wasn\u2019t paying very much attention to that when I ordered, and it\u2019s not that distracting). It also came with extra button in case one comes off. Feels like B/B+ quality; I\u2019m writing this the day it arrived, so only time will tell how it will hold up.

I'm very glad I purchased this shirt. The reason I held one star back (4 Stars instead of 5) was due to stretching after washing. Maybe I'll try cold water wash instead of warm.",

Hopefully still fits after it is washed, but it says to only hang dry and not put in the dryer.",

The fabric was pilling up after the third wash.  After looking at the inside label i was shocked to see the most absurd label ever.  DRY CLEAN recommended. WHAT?  have you ever seen that on a t-shirt and especially one of this horrible quality.  I would not wast dry-clean money or time on such a crappy shirt.

            "I'm 6'3\" 215 lbs with about a 37\" waist. The XL have been fine.  I really like longer shirts that stay tucked in at work instead of bunching up under my dress shirt.  I've ordered Jockey shirts that were way more expensive but were obviously better quality material when comparing side by side.  But since it's just an under shirt, these are perfect.  They do shrink up A LOT.  I ordered a second pack and compared one to a shirt I had been washing/wearing and there was a difference of several inches in length, at least an inch in sleeve, and probably a couple inches in chest.  So when you open the pack, keep that in mind.  They start out huge but shrink down when washed.",

These fit him perfectly! More of an athletic fit. He is so happy with them. They are also super soft. Great buy!",

It's hard to find tall clothing in the stores with out them being big as well, and the subscription service is the best. one pack every 3-6 months and my wife doesn't complain about me staining them any more. I wouldn't wear them by them selves, but I'm also a big fat guy that just wanted some undershirts that didn't shrink up after washing a couple times.",

I'm sure there's other guys out there who can't stand how short a lot of the T-shirts are. I hate it when you lift your arm and it looks like your wearing a friggin belly shirt. Im average height 5'10 and If In having these trouble than I know there has to be others as well. Do yourself a favor and order a pack if these. You can thank me later!",

The amazon reviews for Fruit of the Loom were really good so I ordered a 3 pack of 3x long, a size larger than usual. Should have stuck with the 2x long, but very happy with my purchase. Extremely high quality, very long, and a terrific price, (around $4.00 per shirt).. order some, you won\u2019t regret it.",
            "These aren't perfect, but darn good enough.  Especially when you factor in the price.  It's tough to find a true big and tall undershirt - many brand I've tried are way to short, or the sleeves are too long, or the neck holes stretches way too much, etc.  But these are just a good, basic undershirt with no major problems in my opinion.  This is the second time I purchased these and the only issue I've noticed is that one shirt in the first package seemed to be slightly smaller than the others.  But after the second package I'm thinking this was not the norm.  I will purchase these again when I need more undershirts.",

I looked into getting him shirts from another company that advertises extra long tees, but found the price of $24.95 per shirt crazy for under shirts! I found these and figured even if they weren't long enough that they would be comparable to what he was already wearing, but they are perfect! Extra long without being too big everywhere else. Not sure if they will shrink up after washing but they appear to be long enough even if they do shrink a little. I am reordering more right now!",

I loved the color combination and how it looked, my uncle loves it and said it fit perfectly! He is always wearing it now and even shared it with his friends on Facebook on how excited he is about the shirt. Seeing it on him is making me want to buy one for my self.

He loved it when I gave it to him and has already worn it several times.",

Also, if you're looking for a soft cotton tee (think of how an H&amp;M tee feels for example), this is definitely not it; the feel is more like a tee you can get at Michaels or Walmart. Not a bad tee overall, just not like the photos.",

Yeah I could lose the weight, but now that I found this shirt (and I plan to buy more) no weight lose for me!!! And my man boobs don't show to much in this shirt either. Only when my nipples get hard, but hey, what woman doesn't love to see some nipple action on a man! Am I right? Or am I right?",

The front flap is at a great length but the back flap goes down pass my butt and looks like I'm trying to pull off a half dress piece.  So I recommend this shirt to talk guys and I think girls could pull this off just get the smallest model.",
            "Hello athleisure shirt! I've been trying to get these specific designed of shirts for a reasonable price, unlike those sold by YouTubers and other fitness-community fam like Gymsharks or Alphalete. I was skeptic at first in terms of fit since I've never worn clothes that is designed like this so I went for my 2 types of sizes that I would normally wear: my regular size of Large and also a Medium to see how it fits. Overall, both fits me well out of the bag/fresh from delivery (more on that later). I'm 5'8\" and 177 lbs. As you can see by the picture, I'm not too muscular nor overweight, just a good mixture of fatness and muscle--roughly 20% - 21% body fat. Anyway, I am wearing a MEDIUM here and my arms are hugging the sleeves and so is my pecs (chest) and it's nicely tapered down and shapes my lower body/waist area. Now for the large, I didn't take a picture, but basically it's almost the same minus the sleeves not hugging my arms as much and also it's slightly longer. BUT I washed and machine dried both of them right away like I would for any of my clothes and both the large and medium shrank a tiny bit, though not enough to make it unwearable. Overall, these are great and fits as expected not only for outing but also wearing it at the gym. I love my first 2 pairs that I instantly ordered some more since, why not? The price is right and it makes anyone out there refresh their looks by having a versatile and stylish shirt in or out of the gym!Note: you dont' necessarily need to be a gym goer to wear these by the way. Anybody can wear it, plus it makes you stand out of the crowd since the design of the shirt is not very common unlike your regular t-shirt or v-neck!",
            "Really good nice product",
            "I bought an XL in this because a men's XL usually leave me plenty of room to wash and dry without too much shrinkage.  Since I had never bought this brand before, I washed it in cold water and hung it up to dry - no heat ever touched this shirt!  Not only did it shrink a little in the chest, it shrunk considerably in length.  Before washing, I had extra room in the chest and it was long enough to cover my rear end.  After, it's a little snug across the chest and only comes halfway down my rear end.  I would recommend sizing up at least 2 sizes if you want to have some room after washing.",
            "I read reviews before buying this shirt and saw that it is a little thin and the stiching is not the best. I figured still worth a shot for the cost. I was plesantly surprised. The shirt i got was not as thin as i had imagined it is still thin but also soft and comfy. It did shrink a little after first two washes but again i expected that. The stiching is light and can easily be ripped but again for the cost this is not as bad as i expected. I got the 2xl and im 6 foot 2 280lbs with a large chest. I was worried the bottom of the shirt would be clingy but it actually fits really well. I was hoping for a little longer so i may go up a size on the next one but only for length reasons.",
            "Update: I just ordered a second one in white to replace the first one that I got which was sewed crooked. This one is a completely different fit and length. It is way longer than the first one I had and a little slimmer throughout. I wish it fit as nicely as the first one minus the defect. I won't be ordering another one of these. I'm very disappointed, I feel like I'm wearing a nightgown with this one.Original review:This shirt fits perfectly. I really love the way it hangs. Unfortunately, I'm giving it 3 stars for the poor quality control. The shirt was sewed crooked and the scalloped bottom was totally asymmetrical, off to one side. The seams on each side were in two completely different places. One side seemed to be in the correct spot, while the other side was clear around on the side of my back! Fortunately, Amazon refunded me. I'm reluctant to order another white one and have the same issue be happening, despite how much I loved the fit of the shirt.I also ordered the charcoal grey colored shirt in the same size and it fits entirely differently. It's much longer and more narrow. It felt and looked too tight for me. I had to return it.Perhaps I'll get the nerve to order another white one soon and fingers crossed that it will be symetrical.",
            "Awesome fit, long, just what I needed.Helps conceal my firearms as I have a longer torso and my normal shirts pop over my firearm.Quality is really really nice, should last a long time.Fits even better once washer.Neck is slightly larger (one star drop) but I did learn they have a premium version which corrects this.Anyways for the price these are amazing.",
            "I love these shirts. I ordered 3 of the olive drab color in size large ( I'm 6', 200lbs, athletic build). After reading some of the other reviews, the first thing I did was look for defects and check that they were all the same size. These are about as thick as a fruit of the loom under shirt (basic white tee) and you cannot see through them. At least in the color I bought. I normally buy the Bella + Canvas long body tee but wanted some color besides black, white, and grey. Comparing the two, these are shorter and thinner but you don't have to pull them up to sit down, they don't interfere with your movement. They cover your rear and fit really well.",

My son liked the first set because they were heavy and the fabric doesn't cling.  However, the new shirts we received today are not as thick. They weigh less than the old ones, which have been washed many times.  The new ones have that silky feel that is so common in shirts and bedding now, and which the old ones thankfully lack.  The tags are very different.  Maybe we received fake Hanes shirts.  Disappointed.  In the photo, the left is an old one, and the right is a new (never washed).  My son hasn't tried the new ones on but the size looks approximately the same as the old, albeit the new haven't been washed.",

They are of excellent quality and have been washed many times without fading or shrinking.  I won't bother wandering through stores again now that I know that I can get exactly what he wants online!",
            "I received these yesterday and I washed them first. Be prepared to use a Shout Color Catcher in the wash. The water turned blue and the Shout Color Catcher turned purple from all the blue dye that came out with the first wash of these T Shirts. After drying them in a dryer, and trying them on, they were just a little tight. I ordered a 2X because I knew they would shrink when washed. I wear an X large T Shirt. With these shirts shrinking after the first wash, they fit as an X large now. It is true they are 100% cotton, but they are not preshrunk cotton when you purchase them. Price was good and the thickness of the T Shirt was good. Having a pocket in the T shirt to hold my eye glass case is why I purchased them.  It is hard finding T Shirts with pockets at your local stores. Just remember to buy one size bigger than what you wear.",
            "My husband wears every other type of Hanes t-shirt in size 2X.  These were too small. Nice feeling shirt but fit at least 1 size if not 2 smaller. He's not gained any weight  or anything so I know for sure it's the shirts.  Luckily they fit my son who usually wears a regular large. So make sure to get at least 1 size larger.",
            "I have bought Hanes men\u2019s beefy short sleeve T-shirts for years, and would like to rate the product 5 stars. According to my personal experience, these kinds of T-shirts are perfect for adult men who like to wear casual t-shirts at home. First of all, the beefy cotton material gives you a sense of comfortability and steadiness. What\u2019s more, all the terrific color options offer customers a variety of choice. I bought these t-shirts, and wear one of them every single day. It definitely gives me a feeling of freshness every time I suit it up. Besides, the t-shirts launder nicely. So far, after the 4th laundry, I have not found any shrink or fade on these t-shirts. With such a quite reasonable and affordable price, I do not think you could spend less money and get a more comfortable t-shirt.",

Be aware, sizing on these shirts are inconsistent.  Not sure what I'm going to do, I guess I'll send them back.  What a pain in the booty.",
            "I bought six of these in XL. I'm 5'9 and 160 lbs. I like to wear my shirts loose, so I opt for the XL which shrinks in the wash to a more manageable size for me. They have no stretch. My sizing experience is probably not a lot of help to others. The quality, however, is great. It's made of substantial cotton, thicker than most t-shirts like Champion. These things will last me several years.",
            "I ordered a number of these, XL, in different colors.  The cut and fit, along with the weight of the material, seems to vary.  After the first wash, they shrank considerably, reducing them down to what other tees would be a 'large.'  On the plus side, they seem to wear well, and with subsequent washings, I'm hoping they will fit just a bit more loosely.  I've really liked the other Beefy-Tees I've had.  All in all, I'd recommend these.  If one tends toward the smaller of their designated size, they may fit well right out of the gate.",
            "A little smaller than almost every other XL shirt I own.The black is typical of what you would expect from any black dye.The stitching quality is hit or miss. I bought 6 packs of these shirts (12 total), and about 1/3 of them have very poor stitching, where the hem is only half stitched in many places (sits between the two stitch pattern of the box stitch they are using). This probably isn't a problem since it's a double stitch, but it's not great.",
            "These \"Beefy T-Shirts\" used to be more true to size.  I ordered a  Large despite the fact that most of my shirts are Medium, thinking that a little more room might prove more comfortable in the hotter months.  I habitually wash new clothes before wearing them so that anything left over from the manufacturing process may be removed.  These \"large\" t-shirts fit like a smallish medium.  I have had some previous experience with the \"beefy t's\" in years past.  They didn't shrink much, and were durable.  These T-Shirts feel a little less substantial than the ones in memory, and a large t-shirt should not feel like a medium after washing it.Given that the price is good, and the quality OK, as long as you keep in mind that they run a bit small, these shirts may work for you.  They fit me, but are like medium rather than size large."

            "Picture quality: perfect! I washed the shirt 3 times and it hasn't faded at all yet.Size: I ordered a size large which is what I normally where in t-shirts, but it was extremely too big. I returned the shirt and ordered a size medium which was still a tiny bit too big, but I don't really like tight shirts anyways so it was fine. So ladies, please order one size smaller!My measurements: (in inches)Shoulders: 38.8\"Bra: 36DBust: 38.9\"Waist: 30.2\"Hips: 37\"Height: 5'2\"Shipping &amp; Returning: I had to return and replace my shirt to a size Medium because I ordered a size Large which was way too big. As long as you follow Amazons instructions, its very easy to return your product or get a refund. The shirt came in good packaging.Arrival: fast.I definitely recommend with product to anyone! But for women, order a size smaller.",
            "Love it! Colors are vibrant and exactly like the picture! I will recommend this company to anyone who want good quality tie dye products! I plan on buying more!",
            "Was skeptical at first but when I tried it on, was I glad I went for it.  100% satisfied as you can see\u00a0in the \u00a0picture below of me and my girlfriend rocking it together.",
            "Love this shirt got in Feb. and could not wait to wear it, yesterday was first 80 degree sunny weather in NY and I was so happy to wear. Can't wait to wear the others I purchased.",
            "Ordered a Neon-Rainbow for my grandson.Predominant color is bright pink. Most of the shirt is covered with bright pink.  Not so on the picture of what the shirt will look approximately like.I didn\u2019t see it until it was delivered to grandson\u2019s home and washed before being worn (no, it did not change color from he wash. Would have returned it prior to washing if I\u2019d have seen it first. That said the quality for the price really is very good.Funny part is I ordered 2 at the same time and the 2nd one, a size child\u2019s S for a 5-6 year old was as advertised and fit my big 4 year old grandson just fine.I know it\u2019s tye dye and colors vary but be prepared for possibly something totally not expected.  In fairness to the seller and because I have to get a different one to replace the pink one, I'm ordering another in totally new color pattern.  Keeping my fingers crossed on the next one.",
            "I loved the colors and the price is right.  I only gave it four stars because it fit a little small and it is advertised as thick cotton but I thought it was thin (I have some T-shirts that are much thicker).  I was going to send it back but my friend really liked it and it fit her so I gave her the first one I ordered and then I ordered a second one at the next size up.  The second one was a little larger than how I normally wear T-shirts but that is fine because I really like the extra roominess.  The T-shirt is very comfortable.  I am thinking about buying some more different colors.",
            "Shirt is tiny for a large!!! Won't order anymore",
            "The shirt is very bright and pretty. I threw it in the wash with my other clothes and everything came out fine. I also dried it in the dryer and I don't think it shrunk. I wasn't sure whether to get a M or L, but ended up going with the L in case it did shrink. I am 5'6\" 160' and 38x32x41. The L fits comfortably but definitely looks like I'm wearing a man's shirt. I think I will try a M next time. I gave 4 stars for the pretty design and fast shipping. The fabric is a little bit coarse though and I wish Colortone would offer a women's cut.",
            "Washed 3X so far, didn't fade yet, shrink or get those tiny balls on it. No sloppy or messed up seams. Not super thin material, more medium weight. I'm a 60's baby and small woman who still likes to wear big t-shirts to bed. This is a little on the smaller side. My skinny sons always wanted XL shirts even as teenagers. The size of this shirt would be fine for them. My stockier son with big shoulders would say this is too tight. I normally buy XL for him, too but would go up to XXL in these shirts. Colors are as pictured. My shirt's spiral is not as tight or as brightly pronounced as example in ad."

            "One of my white v-necks \u2013 which I had owned for years \u2013 was pilled at stained. When bleach could no longer guarantee me at least a stain-free shirt, I realized that it was time to replace it. I wanted something a bit more upscale than whatever Chinese mass manufacturer I had bought my previous shirt from, but I had a hard time justifying spending $20 for a shirt that is not much more complicated two pieces of cloth sewn together. This item from Goodthreads seemed to hit a sweet spot.PROS- Good material- Adequately assembled- The neckline does not swoop downThe tag says that the shirt is 100% cotton, but it is surprisingly stretchy. I do not recall my other shirts being quite so pliable, but I am not complaining. The fibers are smooth and the fabric breaths well, which is perfect for looking good even in blazing Hawaii weather. After the first wash, there were a couple loose strings, but the seams look to be of reasonable quality and I do not except them to unravel or for more strings to come apart.However, what I most appreciate about the shirt is that the neckline does not plunge downwards, which seems to be an increasingly popular style these days. I want to see my collar bones, not my chest hair. If you are looking for something more revealing, this is not your shirt.CONS- NoneI have nothing bad to say about this shirt yet.CONSIDERATIONS- Seems to run on the small side- Uncertain longevityThe one thing that you should note is that this shirt runs rather small. I ordered a medium, but it feels close to a small. I prefer a looser fit, so I think I might order a size up next time. However, if you enjoy tops that hug you a bit more, this is up your alley.The shirt was $12, so I am not expecting it to become a family heirloom. However, I am curious to know how well it will hold up as the washes accumulate. I will update this review as necessary, but \u2013 at the time of this writing \u2013 I would encourage anyone to buy it.",
            "I am so sad to write a one star review for these - especially after recommending them to so many of my friends. I should have waited a few weeks before telling people that these were amazing.Firstly, the fabric and fit is outstanding. This is primarily why I told so many people they were great.I was looking to replace my American Eagle t-shirts that I had for about a year; and not because they had any holes or rips, but they were just starting to look run down. I had previously purchased Goodthreads button down shirts and was very happy with the quality, so I figured I\u2019d try their T-shirt\u2019s and bought one in each color.When they arrived, I was blown away. From the stretchy material (that wasn\u2019t too stretchy), to the modern fit - this was everything I wanted in a tee. Especially since I wear a lot of tee\u2019s under blazers for work. I liked them so much that a week later, I went and bought three more, per color!A few weeks later, my Goodthread tees from my first round of purchases started to come apart at the neck seams. It happened to one, so I thought it was random/a lemon. Then it happened to a second and third tee!For the price point (which is the same at American Eagle), these tees should be able to go 6 months to a year without seams failing. Unacceptable and I really feel like I wasted my money. Worst off, this puts a damper in my faith in the overall brand; if you can\u2019t get basics nailed down - why would consumers trust your more complicated apparel?I DO NOT recommend this product, unless you want throw-away/dispensable fashion.",
            "I was very impressed with the quality of the fabric and construction.  It is far superior to a similar shirt I have bought many colors of at Nordstrom.  What impressed me even more is when I washed it today and it washed up FAR superior to the Nordstrom version, for about 60% the price... this is a BEST BUY in my book.  If you are concerned about the sizing, I would go a size up,,, it runs a touch on the small side, though I would say standard for a \"slim\" fit.  I'm 5'10\" and 155lbs... bought a small.  I like things a hair on the small side, not baggy.",
            "These are very good t-shirts. I wear a lot of suits and sport coats for work and I don't want a heavy t-shirt under my dress shirt. These have a little stretch to them and fit slightly snug which is about want I want. I've paid as much as $70 for a Sunspel t-shirt from England and these compare favorably to those in my opinion. They are soft and I like the high quality cotton.",
            "After reading reviews that these shirts are slim fight I went one size up and it fits perfect. These are awesome shirts for the price, I just wish they had more color options.",
            "I'm looking for organic cotton shirts to knock around in on evenings and weekends. I thought this looked like a good deal for organic. The shirt fits fine through the chest and waist. Even the arm holes fit fit. Oddly, it feels tight and uncomfortable through the underarm, almost like it's sewn on up too high. The shoulders have an odd hump in the middle, too.I've only washed it once so I don't know how it wears.I'm 5'9\" and 175 lbs.",
            "These are the shirts I have been looking for!  I would be considered an athletic build at 6'1\", 215 lbs. and I don't like to wear shirts that are too tight, but also don't look like ponchos.  I purchased an XL to try the fit, then promptly purchased a couple other colors.  This has a very classic design, a slightly elastic feel, and very comfortable.  It's inexpensive, classic, and comfortable.",
            "Quality is great and fit is super. I'm 6'4\" 215lbs and XL fits great.",
            "Overall small size, not true fit. Arm opening are for skinny kids.",
            "I purchased these shirts based on Amazon reviews, and I was not disappointed. They fit snugly but not too tightly, and they are long enough that they do not come untucked, even though I have a long torso. The fabric itself is excellent. It is soft, smooth, and stretchy, in just the right proportions.  The V-neck is not too low, but it is just low enough, and the fit is good enough not to move , then I can wear it under an open collared shirt without it showing. This is a perfect undershirt."

            "Nice looking shirt, but the part where they say the 6\u20191\u201d model has on a Medium shirt is crap. I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d in a large... and it\u2019s super tiny I could not get it off.",
            "This shirt is definitely slim. Perfectly fitted around the torso and doesn't look like a parachute like so many other button down shirts do. The arms are perfect in length but are a bit tight if you have larger than average biceps/triceps. I am 5'9\"/180lbs and got a size Medium, which was almost too tight around my arms but fit perfectly everywhere else, so I'm sticking with it. Plan ahead if you're a fellow gym rat and have/want big arms.Otherwise, the material is better than expected and I dig the design as well.",
            "The shirt fits great. It is a size 2x slim. My husband did not think you would like this as it is covered in flowers, that is his quote. I look at it and I see a beautiful hunter green shirt covered in mini flowers of red blue dark blue magenta gray white dark dark green deep maroon red button down shirt goes with everything I've seen my husband wear it with his Fievel ones with his chino pants to shirt it looks great with everything you just try it with a prime wardrobe if you don't like it send it back but just asking you to try it because I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised everything I've purchased from Prime wardrobe has been pleasantly surprising and there's only been one thing that I don't like that I actually sent back and that was no problem at all so if you haven't tried the prime wardrobe thread do so because you really have nothing to lose.",
            "I got the XL and it was significantly slimmer than the old navy slim fit xl - which is good, because that shirt is like a bag on me. It fits similarly to the slim fit Large, with looser arms and a slightly tighter hip area - I have both hips and a butt, so if room in that area is a concern, be forewarned. But it doesn't look like it is riding up if I wear it lifted a bit, either.The material is nice and thick without being warm.I haven't had a chance to wash it, I will update should anything horrible happen! But I look forward to more goodthreads shirts. (Gimme good patterns....)",
            "The fit for this product was to be expected except that it was 2-4\" longer than shirts from comparable brands. I compared to shirts from H&amp;M, J.Crew, Banana Republic, and LL.Bean and this shirt was a minimum of 2 inches longer than all of them.I normally wear a medium and I am 6'0. Normally a button up shirt would only be this long if it was a formal dress shirt. Since this product is clearly a casual shift(and described as such), I'm not really sure what fit they were going for.Your only option will be to tuck this shirt in.I really love the design of this shirt, but I cannot walk down the street wearing a shirt that is clearly cut wrong.",
            "I\u2019ve had this shirt for a whole now and it\u2019s become one of my favorite shirts. It\u2019s been thru the wash plenty of times and it has held up very well.",
            "I really like this shirt.  It's well made of nice material, feels good, looks great, and the price is fabulous.  (I have a couple of comparable shirts from another company that I paid almost double for.)  Highly recommended.",
            "Ordered XXL. Compared to 95% of other XXL fits, it runs very small. Great quality otherwise.",
            "Bought for my husband- he\u2019s gotten tons of compliments on it! It\u2019s longer which is good if you dry your shirts so it won\u2019t shrink up too short.",
            "I'm pretty satisfied with this order. I randomly came across this in trying to find a decent white button up. I was looking for a white shirt with maybe some cool print on it. I loved how small these anchors were and far away just looks like a white shirt but up close could tell theres a small design on them. It looks great on my boyfriend too. Fits to size."

            "This is a very reasonable, sub-ten dollar long sleeved T-shirt. The size was as expected; however, the black is not jet black, which was apparent even after one washing in only cold water. It is also on the thinner side. If you are looking for something as a layering item, something to throw on for the gym, or similar, it as very adequate for that purpose and is priced fairly for that use.I personally would not wear it for other than outdoor chores, working around the house, sleeping on a cold night, or the gym. Your mileage may vary. If the colour had held better, I'd give it another star. While thinner, it has held up well fabric-wise, as well as the stitching.",
            "I ordered the Oxford grey. It is NOT 100% cotton. It is 10% polyester, so it didn't shrink much when washed and tumble dried. I buy 100% cotton shirts one size bigger because they always shrink in the clothes dryer (especially the sleeve length), regardless of whether it \"preshrunk\" by the factory. The seller needs to correct the information for this item to show that it is NOT 100% cotton. If some colors are 100% cotton and other are not, then the seller needs to clarify this in the product information.",
            "I bought 2 of these, one cardinal red and one olive green.  Colors are fairly representative as advertised.  Great price but material is thinner than I had hoped.  Won't provide much for warmth but would be a nice layer to an outfit.  I am 5\" 8\" and fluctuate between 210-220 pounds with the extra weight being around the mid-section.  Size is everything and buying clothes online has always been a challenge for me.  All in all, this is a nice long sleeve shirt if you can match a size to your body.  The XL fit is close for me but probably better suited more as an undershirt for layering purposes but a bit too tight for wearing on it's own on my size frame.  An XXL would most likely hang too long on me and perhaps a bit too loose but would be OK for something to sleep in.  Since I am not with the perfect body, the trick for me is finding the fit for the purpose.",
            "Good fit. Looks just like the product photo. Maybe slightly darker.  My issue with it is I bought this due to the product description advertising it as being 100% cotton...it's not.  The tag says 50% cotton/50% polyester and it feels like it.  It is still a good shirt for the price, just don't expect 100% cotton.",
            "It's pretty light in the collar department. I think(?) most men, me at least, judge a T Shirt by it's collar. Whimpy collar, thin collar, collar that doesn't keep it's shape etc, that's a bad shirt. Thick collar, beefy collar etc, that's what manley men want on their T Shirts. This shirt's collar is not the whimpiest I've seen but it's just not up to the Fruits and others. Colors good, collars bad.",
            "I'm not sure how these 100% cotton T shirts came to be so rough but they feel like 120 grit sandpaper right out of the bag. I would return them if it weren't for the hassle and the fact that they are a low priced item. I purchased a multi pack Fruit Of The Loom short sleeve T's this summer and they were perfect. I should have taken note and purchased their long sleeve version. I have never felt 100% cotton that had this rough texture, hopefully they will improve with some washing's, if not I will donate them to a shelter. Cannot recommend this product and read no comments to the quality of this 100% cotton that were negative.After washing cold and drying hot the material of this shirt softened substantially.",
            "I bought two of these T-Shirts having my reservations on the quality verses the price. I was surprised that they were a great fit but waited to post my review until after I washed them. Surprise again, not much shrinkage at all after a few washings.I really like the fit around the neck and the length is much longer than the \"Fruit of the Loom\" shirts I previously purchased.I just ordered five more!",
            "Horrible material, I washed it multiple times, soaked it in Downy and it stayed like thin sack cloth.  I wore it and the material is uncomfortable and the rim on the inside of the neck was an irritant to my neck.  This is pretty much the same crap material that is sold on the internet to people who are looking for a 'soft' comfortable shirt.  While the name \"MJ Soffe\" is an old name, it, in my opinion, gives one to believe it is 'soft'.....NOT&gt;&gt;I won't even donate this over priced rag to a thrift store.",
            "I actually like this brand better than Russell. Better fit for me and material seems a bit thicker. Never heard of MJ Soffe before but the price was comparable so gave them a try. Wasn't disappointed. I like cotton shirts as they get softer and softer over time and breathe really well. Everyone has different body shapes so will have different opinions about clothes. If MJ Soffe is still around when I need more shirts I will buy from them. I noticed that in the clothes world that if you find something that fits well......buy several more now because when you need more they might change the product or might not be in business in the future.",
            "I have a hard time finding decent fitting long sleeve tee's.  Other products, after you wash them one time they are either too short, or shrink too much and the fit is terrible. Found these on Amazon and took a chance.  They are great quality and fit perfect.  I'm a big guy, 200lbs and 6'1\".  So I buy Extra Large and after one washing they fit perfect! I have them in Black, Brown and White and the Quality is all the same. Will keep buying them if the quality stays the same!"

            "I ordered this shirt and also the \"Gildan 5.3 oz. Heavy Cotton T-Shirt\" to compare them. This\"Gildan Men's Ultra Cotton Tee\" is definitely a heavier weight cotton than the \"Gildan 5.3 oz. Heavy Cotton T-Shirt\".So basically the \"heavy cotton\" shirt is thinner.I am guessing this \"Gildan Men's Ultra Cotton Tee\" is 6.0 oz. or more. It's better quality. The \"Gildan 5.3 oz. Heavy Cotton T-Shirt\" is getting returned.",
            "the fit is as angular and sturdy as you'd expect from a heavier gildan tee. it's solid. but after even one cold wash, the bottom hem WILL begin to flip upward and there's no real solution for it except maybe ironing for each wear but i haven't tried that. i got multiple ultra cotton tees (seven colors including three whites) and they all have this same problem. luckily all of them together only cost about the same as buying one or two high-quality shirts. still a bummer though.",

Some larges can be too large  on me, but this one fits great. A medium would have been too small. These are a quality weight t-shirt also.",
            "In this global manufacturing economy, I have a hard time finding consistency in size and quality from order to order on any clothing.  I was very pleased to find Gildan's Ultra Cotton Tee is still true to the size and quality of material they used three years ago.  I now intend to order a 5 year supply.",
            "The shirt is slightly smaller than I anticipated (in fabric allowance).Although it's comparable to Hanes' Beefy T, I felt the Gildan was slightly thinner (to be fair, it is 6oz vs Hanes' 6.1oz). You can check by holding up the shirt to a light and seeing how much passes through. Obviously, use the same color shirt for both experiments.Compared to fit vs the Hanes' Beefy T, the Hanes' shirt is slightly more comfortable. I honestly don't think the .1oz makes any significant difference, but it does sit differently on the body. I prefer the Hanes' shirt, but it doesn't make sense to return this Gildan which is available for only $2.95.",

I've had to replace my entire wardrobe and I don't have a lot of money budgeted for myself (I've got a kid and a house so there ya go).These shirts come in all kinds of fun colors and they don't cost much. But they are a good, middleweight cotton and they are durable. Pair these with a nice sweater or jacket and who's know they were cheap-o T's?",

(I'm 5'9\" and got the XL for extra length).  The white one isn't transparent which is great.  The material is as soft as some other brands, but it's still comfortable.

            "I purchased three of these XL T-Shirts for winter inside wear and was disappointed that they are much closer to Large in size than to XL.PROS:  Nice moderate weight T-Shirt.  Seem well made.CONS:  These T-Shirts certainly are not a true XL.  Both that have arrived so far are consistent in size, but when laid over a true XL T-Shirt that has been washed many times, they are about 1-1/2 Inches narrower across the shoulder seam and over an inch narrower at the armpit seam.  They compare closely with several Large size T-Shirts I own. These comparisons were made after only one cold washing of the new T-Shirts, so I anticipate further shrinking.  The shirts to which they were compared have been washed many times. These T-Shirts were not as heavy weight as I had anticipated, too.CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: I have been wearing Gildan tank tops in Large Size for many years now and have found them to be pretty much run true to size from multiple orders over several years.  Thusly, I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the sizing of these T-Shirts but will find use for them as outside work shirts.  I prefer loose fitting, heavy weight T-Shirts for inside, comfort wear, and I will have to look elsewhere.  Also, as mentioned above, I had hoped that the advertised weight of the cotton material would run to the heavy side but also considered that finding a nice, heavy weight T-Shirt might be a trial and error process.  All in all, these seem to be decent T-Shirts, but I would not recommend them based on size alone.",
            "I purchased the olive green color.  First washing, the metal buttons left about 10 circular discolorations on the fabric as if bleached; the buttons on sleeves and epaulets now have bluish-green corrosion similar to patina on bronze or copper.  There's no oxidation on the pocket and placket buttons.  Shirt sat for maybe a few hours after wash cycle finished.  If you're washing this shirt. don't let the wet garment sit in machine, and maybe avoid using Oxiclean or detergents with Oxiclean.  I recommend the manufacturer replace these metal buttons with khaki green plastic ones, or a more corrosion resistant metal.  Notes: (1) washed using Arm &amp; Hammer with OxiClean (possibly causing the corrosion); (2) have not seen this problem with other garments with metal buttons; (3) water is not corrosive or acidic."

After one wash (cold water, low heat dry), the shrinkage of all these shirts was astounding. They tightened around the neck, arms, and I lost about two inches of length. Now, I have to wear my pants up high to avoid a crop-top look (trust me, no one wants that). Plus, they faded almost instantly.

            "I got one (yes, a SINGLE) dirty T-shirt from China that wasn't even Gildan. Hmm.",
            "I love these. I wore both Haines and Fruit of the loom, and other brands, but this is the only one that's durable, fade resistance (color), and keeps the neck unstretched after you wash it.These are usually sold out in Walmart where I usually get them. And I'm happy that these are all blacks, because that's the hardest colors to find without having other colors in the pack.The arm, neck, shoulder, and torso is all great size. It runs long enough length wise on the bottom of the shirt to tuck it in your pants for when you wear it underneath the shirt, unlike the other brands.Good job.",
            "I could nitpick things I don't like about this shirt but when you consider that these 10 shirts average out to 2 dollars, the value of this purchase shines through. The fabric isn't amazing but perfectly survivable and the overall fit of the shirt is nice. Now I have 10 of them.",
            "I wear a large T-shirt and I would say this is a little bigger than the other shirts I own. Not overly big. Kinda like a pair of loose or relaxed jeans. Some people might like that but I work with a lathe and you don't want to have lose fitting shirts on. I lathe can rip it off in seconds if your not still in it. But I do like the price and the 10 pack is nice way to buy a lot of work shirts. The color is a little lighter than I was hoping for but still happy anyway. the will be darker in the weeks to come."

Unfortunately for me, mediums are almost always too short but fit great otherwise and larges are just a hair longer but way too fat.this shirt was long enough and slim enough to be nearly perfect for me in medium! Finally!",
            "This is under half the price of a high end Nike or UnderArmour polo shirt but matches up quite well. It looks good and fits nicely. I like the 3 buttons but buttoning 2 of the 3 may fit some people's necks poorly. It's really light and stretchy so it feels great. Put all that together and the value is crazy good. I bought the gray one and will most likely buy the blue one soon. The only thing I've had trouble finding is other shirts by this company. Maybe this is all they offer but I'd really like to buy some more from them. Jolt team, feel free to reach out and let me know where you carry more product.FYI, I am 6'5\" and a pretty standard build. I bought an L and it's just long enough for me and the sleeves are a perfect length as well. If I had a barrel chest I would need an XL but the large worked great for me.",

He loves these shirts in black and blue, but doesn't care as much for the red. The red is a coral color (peach, pink tones) slightly less vibrant than the photo.  The fabric is great for summer and is holding up well so far. The included mesh laundry bag is a nice bonus.",
            "Light and very comfortable.I wore it and washed it in it's very well designed and made washing bag with the other laundry and dried in its bag.  I came out clean and wrinkle free!Ready to wear again.Material is light but shirt seems well constructed.Was shipped quick.I got both colors and hope they offer other colors and designs as well.",
            "UPDATE 4/10/17 I bought second shirt in black and it's great just like the first purchase in blue. I bought medium and it fits very well, but I think just a little bigger than most mediums. I have extra room in shoulders, length and arms. Some people who buy in most shirts and have little extra room might want to consider medium. The medium was just a bit larger than most mediums that I have purchased. I really like the quality of these shirts. I would buy additional shirts, but right now I only see the two colors. There you go. Good luck!Initial review: Great shirt. This is a Dry Fit that is very fine in quality. I bought the blue and will buying the black soon.",
            "I am between a M &amp; L.  Large fit great and was really good for golf.  Left room to move.Great material.  Soft and comfortable. Shirt \"dealt great\" with a humid sweaty day.  I live in Florida and the days are hot and humid.  Especially on the golf coarse.I am planning on getting more shirts.  Just got the one to try it out.  Wish they had more colors.Also the laundry bag was a nice extra.  Wish that had a \"draw\" string or type \"handle\", but a nice gift.",
            "Good deal on two shirts (got discount)! Quality is on par with what you would find in a Nike or Under Armor golf shirt! Exactly the type of deal I am always looking for because I don't care to have a name brand logo, just quality. I would buy more shirts like this if there were different designs!Positives:Material is thin, breathable and very stretchy. As others have said, the collar is very nice; it has a thicker weight to it and holds up well. The polo has a sporty fit; I am 6'1\" and 235lbs and the XL fits just right.Negatives:Material is almost too stretchy, which makes it difficult to tuck in and get the right amount pulled out. No issues with the logo wearing off, but definitely looks susceptible to it. When taken out of plastic, there is a hint of vinegar smell to the shirt and I could still smell it after the first wash, but went away after second wash.",
            "I love this shirt. I bought the blue one as well. Great material and fits me perfect. Looks sharp. I use these types of shirts for work all the time (I'm in sales) and this one is great when I do not have to wear a dress shirt. I used it for its intended purpose of golf as well. I will update if there are quality long term issues",
            "This is the second shirt that i have purchased from Jolt Gear and once again the product was amazing. I am going to continue to buy because of the great fit and above-par feeling. My favorite types of polos are the ones that are light in weight and have a stretch to them, and Jolt's shirts fill both of these areas. Not only do I wear them on the golf course, but I also wear them to work because of their professional look. The only downside I have about Jolt is they only currently have 4 colors. Once they come out with more colors, I will be sure to buy more!",
            "I absolutely love these shirts.  They fit perfectly!  I ordered the medium (I'm 5'7\", 185, 38\" chest).  Ordering shirts is usually a gamble.  You never know if \"medium\" is going to be a squarish shirt that hangs off the body a little, or if it means skinny-boy Abercrombie model with stick limbs. This shirt can be tucked in or not, and the included garment bag is a nice touch."

I was really disappointed when I received the shirts I had ordered and tried them on. The shirts were so itchy and nothing like the softness people had told me about when they referred to Carhartt shirts. My skin felt as though I was getting a rash from whatever kind of material they used to make the shirts. I then came to find out that Carhartt shirts were being made in Haiti and not America anymore and it was no longer an American company. Some might say it doesn't make that much difference things being made in other countries but, try one of these shirts on and tell me you wouldn't have wanted a more quality type shirt to wear made with better materials here in America. I'll definitely be returning the shirts I ordered. Save your money don't buy these shirts. You won't get the quality of an item you would've expected from the Carhartt.",

Do not have to worry about if it will shrink. Design and style looks very good, I like it. Has medium print logo of Carhartt on back near neck part and large print logo on left sleeve side. Great for beach wear, park, outdoors, or everyday wear. It feels pretty comfortable to wear.",

While the new ones fit the same, which I like, the material is lighter, has tiny ridges and seems to pick up every hair for a mile around! My old shirts are a nice smooth thick cotton that doesn't stretch and is thicker; over all much nicer shirts.But I guess these are the only way we can get them now, so much for advancement when products have to be cheapened to still be affordable.",

He wears Gillette Endurance gel antiperspirant.  We've never had this kind of thing happen before.  I suspect the dye in the shirt is at fault.

            "This is a review for all Hanes Nano shirts in general (I have maybe 10-20 of them).If you wear them fresh out of the box, they're great - I really have no complaints. You'll think they're so great, in fact, that you'll probably order another 10-15 in various colors just to have around.Unfortunately, after washing them 1-3 times, they've become unwearable for me. They shrink somewhat noticeably (it's not insane, but they became tight enough that I don't want to wear them anymore), and they ride up like crazy around your back. I'm not sure how, but if I'm sitting or lying down, or even biking, I'll need to adjust the shirt every at least 10-20 minutes because it will have managed to fold up 2-3 times around my waist. This might have something to do with the fit (though I doubt that's the only issue), but it makes these pretty much unwearable for me unless I know I'm going to be standing or walking around all day.I also dislike the arms on these - they flare out like crazy, and I don't think it could possibly look good unless you've got really big biceps (I don't). Personally, I didn't notice this until I got another shirt to compare it to, but it really sticks out to me now (and not in a good way). A few of them have also had long threads start coming out (especially around the sleeves), though this doesn't bother me as much.I've recently started switching to Next Level shirts and they're amazing in comparison - they're noticeably softer, the sleeves are much better fitting and they never ride up. If you decide to buy Hanes shirts, I urge you to seriously consider getting one of the Next Level shirts for comparison (they cost roughly the same amount). I can't imagine anyone preferring these shirts.",
            "I am allergic to polyester and specifically bought these shirts because they said 100% cotton.  They arrived with a tag that says 90% cotton and 10% polyester.  False advertising!",
            "Not real happy with the T-Shirts, wrinkle easily, very flimsy, not holding up well with just a few washings.  Still looking for the equivalent of that Russell T shirt that I bought almost a decade ago.  Paid a high price for it but it has held up so well it still looks good.  I will wager it will look better in another 3 months than these nano t shirts will.  I can't get a Russelll to hold up as well lately either and  I have tried many brands looking for a good T.  Carhartt is great but they are heavy for the summer.  Probably have to go with buying cheap cotton tees at wally world and just using them for cleaning rags after a few monthsStarted throwing these away, something I'll do only as a last resort... they are shrinking and don't look good and fit weird....Hanes....never again!",
            "I really don't get the few poor reviews.....if they fell apart, obvious flook quality control issue. The problems ref quality, come on!!!!Two shirts for $8.69. However, I got to say that I have purchased a lot more expensive T shirts that didn't feel as good as these, and these look just as good. I work outside and go through a lot of T shirts due to dirt grime, etc. This is the perfect shirt, but I gotta say I have no problem wearing them casually either. Washed three times and have had no damage and remove them after drying and no wrinkles. Guess if you store your clothes in the dryer like I  do form time to time, you may have some wrinkles.If your looking for an inexpensive t shirt that looks good and holds up, don't hesitate.",
            "Second time buying these. They are cut a little (like, a little, not slim-fit) slimmer, and they are a few inches longer than most regular Ts. They also shrink, especially around the arm hole, which causes the sleeve to flair out, and fold up with any arm movement. After a while, the neck will sag.Here's the deal: I use these as sleep/lounge shirts. For this purpose, they're great! I'm a cold sleeper; I'm very sensitive to air movement around my legs and bottom. the longer length means the shirts don't ride up and expose my bottom to the cold air; in fact, I wish they were a little longer. Now, I can't sleep in anything else.They are soft and comfortable - not too thick, not too thin. If I have to go out and grab something from the mailbox, or take the dog out, I can, it just looks like I have a lived-in T on, and not pajamas. For this purpose, I recommend.",

When I ironed on the first logo, it all melted together because of the polyester.  Please correct the ad!!!",
            "The fit is as expected. I also like its thickness, not too thick and not too thin. However, the quality control is abysmal (this word reminds me the scene in which Joey Tribbiani from Friends was happy about the review saying his acting skill is abysmal.) After first wash, it falls apart. Don't buy unless your skill to patch clothes is not abysmal.",

The shirts that were shipped to me although good quality in general, had two extremely annoying plastic tags sewed to the inside back of the collar. There's no way to wear these t-shirts in comfort with those tags still attached. when you remove the tags there is no way to tell what is front or back on the T-shirt except for the shoulder seams which is a pain in the @$$ to deal with every time you put it on. Furthermore when you remove the tag the stitching on the caller where the tag was becomes loose and starts fraying. I'm not pleased with the seller because of their misrepresentation of the product, and I'm not happy with the shirt because it will deteriorate quickly with those loose seams at the back of the collar. Choose another vendor who doesn't miss misrepresent what they're selling.",
            "I really love these shirts. I can't believe they are this inexpensive. I'm the type of person who can't wear a shirt if it's even slightly \"itchy.\" These are super soft and fit well. They have a nice modern cut to them with shorter, fitted sleeves and a slim torso. They have a nice length to them which makes it easier to tuck them in if you're wearing them as an undershirt, but not so long that they look odd when wearing them alone.",

These fit absolutely perfect, after a wash it will lose just a little length but have continued to be just what I was looking for.  One star subtracted as one of the shirts has already started to have its stitching come loose at the waist, but at this price point and the continued integrity of the clothing I can handle some stray threads.These coupled with moisture-wicking boxers have completely revolutionized my summers here in the south.",
            "I read the other reviews prior to ordering this shirt and saw that they run small. I normally would wear a 3XLT, in this case I bought a 4XLT. It fits me just right. Glad I went big. I am happy with this purchase. I have washed this shirt several times and I have not noticed any shrinkage or any problems with the stitching. My only complaint with the shirt was the tag, it was a little itchy, but that was easily fixed by cutting it off. I am 6' and 340lbs. I have a 54\" waist and this shirt covers everything when I raise both arms. That's what I was looking for. A work shirt that will keep me cool while keeping the fat covered up.",
            "My husband is SO picky when it comes to shirts, and any clothes really. He's about 6 feet tall, and build very broad. He also team ropes on horses. So he likes to wear shirts that will stay tucked in while he is riding down the arena and swinging his rope.He also has very large arms, so that is usually hard to find shirts that fit in that area as well.He absolutely loves these shirts. Especially for now in the summertime when it's so hot out!They are so soft and silky and fit around his arms and stay tucked in. I get him the xlarge tall so that it is longer. We have the navy, maroon, and grey so far and I am sure I will end up ordering more. They are very breezy and made well. He is hard on his clothes, working outside with animals all the time, and these shirts have held up very well. They are not sure tight on him, and not super loose. They fit just right. He normally wears an xlarge in shirts, so this is true to size.",
            "I have a few athletic shirts like this.  They all dry quickly; hence, the \"Dri\" brand name. But keep in mind that none leave you feeling like you haven't sweat.  Don't expect a dry shirt after the workout - if you put in the work, you will get these soaked.  With that said I love the feel, how it hangs (never grabs the skin, even when wet), and the light weight.  I regularly choose these style shirts over cotton.  I wear them alone - no undershirt.  I've chosen this brand twice, and the big/tall 2xl (I'm 6'4\", 260lbs, 3-5-mile runner most days) covers nicely whether I'm working abs, running or raising weights above my head - I never have to worry about the shirt being too short.  Wash on cold, dry on low or let hang dry (will hang dry in 4 hours).  I never machine-dry completely.  They stand up nicely to wrinkles, so fold and place a few in your gym bag.  They'll save some bag space, and they look good.",

It's very light, cool, and covers my gut through all types of exercises in the gym.  I'm 6'0 215 and this shirt gives me about 4-5 inches below the waist and also plenty of length in the sleeves.  The Large was not too loose and not too tight - just right to feel good but show off the guns :)  I think for a shirt with no major label / brand, it should be a few bucks cheaper, but I will buy more.  I'm spoiled with the lightweight feel.  Let's hope other colors are consistent with sizing.",

I\u2019m 6\u20191 and 175, and these are plenty long enough so you don\u2019t have to \u201cworry\u201d when bending over.  Also, if you forgot to fold/hang them and they are left in the dryer, they don\u2019t wrinkle the way ordinary shirts would.  It\u2019s a very forgiving shirt, a very lightweight shirt, a very comfortable shirt, a very cool looking shirt, and a very very long shirt (L/T).  5+Stars for something that is otherwise very difficult to find.",
            "Great t-shirt/undershirt. Unlike cotton these dry quickly both right out of the wash, hung up (they never go in the dryer) and when worn and you are sweating. I got the tall version so they stay tucked in, and they do. Even if you've been moving around these stay nicely. Yes, I've seen a few stray threads and and had to have a small section of hem resewn on one, otherwise no issues. The white ones I've owned for over a year have remained white and look crisp and clean showing at the neck of a dress shirt, nor have the collars lost shape.If anything could be improved it would be the way this material holds odor especially after one wearing on hot days. But I think that is a normal characteristic of poly. These are perfect for travel too, as said before, they wash and air dry fast.",
            "The sizing on these shirts seems way off. We ordered a shirt in a size LARGER than my husband would normally wear and when the shirt arrived it was still too small and tight (both length and width). It was certainly pink enough though and we gave it to my father-in-law who is smaller than my husband and it fit him perfectly. But it's nuts that this shirt is sized at least two sizes off of what it should be."

            "It's a decent shirt for the money. I normally buy medium shirts because after it shrinks, it fits prefect. This might have been preshrunk so a medium was too big. I had to get a small. I wish all shirts were like this because it would be easier to tell what will actually fit properly.",
            "I ordered 3 of these and will no doubt order more. This is a great value for a basic Henley. It's thin but not paper thin which is exactly what I like in a Tee, most of the time it's either too thick or way too thin. I've also not seen any construction issues, defects or discoloration. The fit is perfect. I am 5'10 and 165, wear a Medium (39.5-40 chest) and these were all spot on (review the measurements in the description and you won't go wrong). These are more of a fitted cut which is what I like....and they're not overly long or blousy, praise the gods. Shirts should not blow like a curtain in the wind nor look like miniskirts. I'll come back to edit if I see anything change after a few washes but so far I could not be happier with these.",
            "The material is thinner than I expected. Style and fit is good. I am 5' 7'' tall, 31'' waist and 38'' chest and the size small fit well.",
            "The shirt looks as good on as it does on line. My husband is hard to shop for and these shirts fit him just right plus they look great on. They are not too fitted and allow a little give in the waist.",
            "Seriously way better than I expected. All I wear are Henley shirts and I haven\u2019t bought one that I really liked. Seriously the material is comfortable and looks high quality. I definitely recommend this shirt to anyone. At the same time, I don\u2019t want too many people to know about it so that everyone has one.",
            "The shirts are great you could wear them alone or under a layer very comfortable with a little stretch",
            "Looks great!  Fits just fine.  I bought a XXL and it's not right at all.  Made amazingly well.  Nice colors.  Can be dressed up or down.",
            "great t shirt"
