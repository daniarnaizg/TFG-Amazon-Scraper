{"asin": "B0775Q16HL", "comments": ["I ordered a two-pack of these Slim Fit t-shirts and a two-pack of the Regular Fit t-shirts to compare and contrast. Both styles are made of the same thick cotton knit fabric, which is soft and substantial, but the fits are definitely different. These Slim Fit shirts are significantly tighter fitting in the stomach, arms, and chest area(s). The Regular Fit shirts are much looser in all three of these areas, especially the arms.Compared to a Regular Fit I would categorize these as a Slim Fit not, a Snug Fit; they fit close to the body but not tightly enough to show something like muscle definition, if that's what you're looking for.For comparison, I would say that these  Amazon Essentials Slim Fit t-shirts are tighter fitting than a standard Gap or Old Navy t-shirt fit but looser fitting than a standard American Apparel or H&amp;M t-shirt fit.Overall the quality is nice, with minimal fading and only very minor shrinkage after laundering in cold water and putting in a medium dryer. Recommended if you like a close fitting, thick cotton t-shirt.", "I bought both medium and large to check for best fit. Before washing, medium fit the best and large was a bit too big. After washing, the medium becomes too small and the large fits better.", "One of the shirts was just as expected; the other one had two different sleeve sizes. The left sleeve is wayyy smaller than the right (and the other shirts sleeves) to the point that it hugs my arm while the other hangs loose.", "The material of the shirts feel really good but they are way to small.I wear a 2XL, the shirts fit like an XL and after washing they turn into a Large, at this point I can not get the shirt on.", "Not sure why these were called slim fit. This is definitely a regular fit shirt. This is one of the few times an Amazon product has disappointed me. It's a decent regular fit shirt, but just call it what it is.", "You can't go wrong with these.  The fabric is soft and the sleeves and torso seem to have a little more intentional length added to them--both plusses in my book for a casual t-shirt.  I ordered a medium and, with about a 16.5'' neck, the rim of the collar comes right up to my neckline--fine for me but might perhaps be a potential warning for guys who are a little more husky or athletic.  I personally love them and will be buying again.", "To loosely quote Mitch Hedberg, \"The shirt feels like a really weak man is choking you\".My biggest complaint is the neck.  It's so small and uncomfortably tight on your neck.  Really the whole shirt fits odd, but the neck is the real problem.  The actual shirt material is fine.  I tossed this shirt pretty early into me having it.Try again Amazon.  Find a better pattern.", "Not worth $6 per shirt. They're fine, undershirt-quality undershirts. I was hoping for a white outershirt tshirt. That's what I wear under my business clothes, because they feel nicer. This isn't that. This is a really expensive undershirt. No tag, comfy, baggy, so an ideal undershirt, but not as good as just getting a white outerwear tshirt from like Gap or something.", "I am 5'10\" 150lbs, with some muscle from strength training. I washed in cold water and dried on low heat before trying the shirt on for the first time and it fits perfect. Please keep these in stock in manly colors and white, thank you.", "The fit of these is great - I'm 6'1\" and 210lbs, bought the Large.I have a tough time finding shirts that are long enough for me - I used to wear J Crew medium tall, and have had luck with Next Level on Amazon but those are inconsistent.  J Crew never has the medium talls in stock any longer and they are thin and poor quality anyway, so took a chance on these.They fit PERFECTLY and feel like they are quality - the material is about twice as thick as the J Crew shirts but it's still very soft/comfortable."]},
{"asin": "B077ZMKWVM", "comments": ["I'm used to Hanes shirts, and these are very comparable in quality and fit. The large fits my 6'1\" frame correctly.My minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.For the price, these are a fantastic buy.", "You are looking at these because you want some white t-shirts but want the cheapest set you can find. These shirts are \"good enough\" for an undershirtz provided that you don't care if they shrink after one wash. If you just wear them under your work shirt and take them off when you get home, these are perfect. If you want to wear these as a shirt by itself, I'm not so sure this is the best option. Maybe I just shouldn't have put this in the dryer but then again other shirts I've done this with haven't shrunk so much.", "bad! bad! bad! Very bad quality under-shirts with extremely thin material. All shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere. Never again any product from Gildan!", "The shirts are comfortable, but the quality control is bad.  One of the shirts had a little white sticker with a red arrow that pointed to a hole in the shirt. Clearly the QC department marked that as a defective shirt, but it was still included in the package even though it was marked as defective.A couple weeks ago I had bought a pack of the same Gildan shirts at Target and one of the shirts had a 1\" diameter hole in it, so apparently this is an ongoing problem with quality control.", "So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting  or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.", "Good price for a 6pack of undershirts. Im 6'3, on the lean side, with a basketball in front.A top notch high end Tshirt, I can get by with a true American large.I ordered an XL on these, expecting a good bit of shrink, like I do other bulk pack T's.The XL fits me absolutely perfect out of pack. Not skin tight, but not a moo moo either.Length out of pack is to my fingertips, arms held down,  like a good sport coat length.Hands up, length covers my belt buckle out of pack.Cheap XL = high end L.After one wash/dry, these drew up about 2 inches, shrank about 1/2-1\" over all girth.The fit actually got better, neck is great, but the length is kinda pushing it for moving around, and bending over etc.It will come un tucked under my work shirt. But so does every other cheap bulk pack non-tall shirt.I really probably should've went with a tall size, but these will do fine for an undershirt.Nice summer weight.", "2nd time ordering these, these are solid shirts. I mean not sure what some people expect from these after reading the reviews. I ordered the 2x which fit me nicely. I wear these mostly for undershirts and they are just fine. SO if you are looking for some inexpensive shirts, might as well buy these lol", "Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts are very comfortable very well made and I would highly recommend them I wear a lot of white shirts and comfort bility and the style and fabric of the shirt is very important to me I  Used to always  Hans but they've got to be very expensive and I don't mind the price but the quality has also been reduced but Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts  Suppress my expectations and if I could give them a 10 star I would I would highly recommend", "Good value for well-made T-shirts. These shirts are all I will buy now. Material is excellent and they do not shrink much.", "The T shirts seem to be of comparable quality to the Hanes shirt I usually get. I haven't washed them yet to see how much they'll shrink. I'm sure they'll shrink some because they are cotton. I consider myself to be a careful shopper so I was worried these shirts weren't going to be good quality because of the price. I've now learned that Hanes charges too much for similar quality."]},
{"asin": "B07BBG8KPS", "comments": ["I'm big boned and incredibly my bones have grown over the years. One way to grow bones bigger is to eat junk food and not move around much. Okay I'm fat. There you happy? I put on a few pounds in the belly region and needed shirts that would cover up my gut. I hate standing there feeling a cool breeze on my stomach only to realize it's because my fat is sticking out. These shirts do the trick. Sure I'm still fat but at least these shirts help cover the skin up so I don't scare random people sending them screaming and crying only to be traumatized for the rest of their lives.Update: I just ordered for the third time.", "This is one issue I've had with the few clothing purchases I've made on line... so often what you see is NOT what you get, which is why I don't often resort to it. I ordered the \"assorted earth tones\" 4 pack, and when you click on the assorted earth tones, what's shown are shirts that look like a steel blue, a brown, an olive green, and I guess what they're calling a \"heather grey\". The description says that they're all 100% cotton, with the exception of the heather grey, which is 90% cotton, 10% polyester. Well, the most important part of the product description is the part that says \"colors may vary\" - you ain't kiddin'!What I ended up getting were two of the EXACT SAME same grayish-blue shirts (90% cotton, 10% polyester) rather than steel blue, a much lighter shade of brown than shown (90% cotton, 10% polyester), and a teal shirt rather than the olive (the ONLY one that's 100% cotton!)These are for my hard-working, blue collar hubby, and he's not really going to care what the colors are - he's always been completely satisfied with the Fruit of the Loom pocket tees I've purchased in the past (he's a big guy, we buy the 3XL size, he likes the way they fit him), and it's nice that they're all tag-less now. But the shirts in this pack are made in El Salvador, and here's what the washing instructions say: \"Para Mexico Lavar Con Detergente/No Exprimir\". My high school Spanish class was a lifetime ago! And I expect to get the colors featured in the \"assorted earth tones\" photo accompanying the choice I clicked on - surely not TWO of the same color, which wasn't even shown!  We like the shirts - just not the misinformation.", "Bought these T-shirts for my son and husband as they are the only shirts my son will wear.  But something has changed and these do not fit like the last ones we bought in the store.  They run small and too long.PROS:  They are soft and don't get twisted when washed.  There is some minimal pilling after multiple wears (like six months of every day wear) but that is to be expected.  Price is great as you get 4 shirts for the price and one shirt in the stores costs $6.CONS:  Size is off.  My son wears a XL and fits XL in other FOL shirts. These ones are way too tight and too long for him.  He said they feel like he's wearing a tube sock as a top. Also, going by the picture we expected two darker grey and two blue but received 3 blue (light blue, darker deep blue, and a grayish blue) and a light grey shirt.", "With this product you get 4 crew neck t-shirts at an inexpensive price.These undershirts are made of cotton which makes them soft and comfortable.The branding and sizing information is stamped on the back of the inside of these shirts, which is great because there are no tags to cause irritation and itching.These undershirts are fairly thin and lightweight, so if you are doing some heavy construction work (or yard work, or etc.) they aren't the most durable.It must be noted that these undershirts will shrink after a couple washes, which could mean trouble for people who wear these tighter to begin with or have long torsos.I purchased these undershirts to wear under my polo shirts at work.  They fit well and I am still able to tuck them into my pants (even after shrinking in the wash), so I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend that you purchase these undershirts if you have similar needs.-In Short-Pros:InexpensiveComfortableAssorted colorsCons:Will shrink after a few washesNot the most durable*Please click \"Yes\" if you found this review helpful. It would be appreciated. Thank you.", "Amazon sent me an email asking me to review these, probably because I keep buying them.I'm not very good at reviewing stuff, but, well...These are very good T-shirts.I mean, if you like T-shirts...Then these are very good T-shirts.(How come no one says my reviews are helpful? It's T-shirts, or boxer shorts...It's not like you're seeking advice on purchasing a pet badger or something. What do you want from me?)", "So lately I have been tryna get into the fashion game and let me tell you, this is a step in the right direction. I went from looking like a average dude to an average dude who can kinda dress. Notice, that I am still an average dude. With that being said, these are fantastic shirts for a great price. I feel more comfortable shooting my shot with these shirts. That should clear some things.Note: I am like 5'4 so keep that in mind while reading this.", "As mentioned above, these shirts are still going strong after 12 months.

Always received the 4 blues shown in each package. Now I received 2 packages each containing 2 powder blue and 2 light green shirts. Only 2 colors (not 4) in each pack and colors that aren't even shown. Must be from the bottom of the barrel. See picture. I have set up a reship and return. Will update but I'll bet the replacements will be just as bad.Update 2/8/2018 - Of course. Replacements sent are IDENTICAL to my first order. Now I'm looking at 8 powder blue and 8 light green shirts, all of which are going back. Aside from the hassle in all of this, my real frustration is I really love these shirts in the colors shown but nobody at Amazon seems to care about straightening this out and I can no longer order these again.", "I'm an average sized guy and purchased a medium.

{"asin": "B07JFZSFSK", "comments": ["Terrible product, I would highly recommend avoiding these T-shirts. I have bought Hanes ComfortSoft shirts before, and what I received are definitely not them.The ComfortSoft shirts are supposed to be tagless so that the collar is not irritating in any way, with the Hanes logo/material/size printed on the fabric directly. The shirts I received had the shirt material and size printed on the cotton, but the Hanes logo was on a tag sewn into the collar....The picture shows shirts without a tag......The section from the manufacturer says \"All the comfort of Hanes with our famous tag-free collar,\"...BUT, the description that Amazon listed says \"White neck tag easily removed for tag-free comfort,\" yet the tag is sewn into the collar. So, clearly, these are not the ComfortSoft shirts, so both the picture and the manufacturer's description are not relevant to what Amazon ships out. Oh, and how is this tag easily removed? Well, I could cut it off and leave a short, sharp, scratchy protrusion of tag sticking out of the collar, or I could rip the stitching, remove the tag, and then re-sew it back together. \"Easily removed?\" Definitely not.The only thing that deserves any credit is that the sizing was as expected, a Medium. But that's before washing, and I'm not keeping them long enough to find out. Highly disappointed in Amazon, and I set about returning my order within 5 minutes of receiving it.", "There's no way these shirts are 90% cotton. The fabric (whatever it is) has quite an abrasive quality to it, and the actual fit is odd in that it makes no difference which way you put it on; the shirt feels the same around the neck and sleeves, even when worn backwards. Probably the worst pack of shirts i've ever owned. Would not recommend.", "I almost didn't buy these because of one of the more critical reviews.  I can see where there might be a batch that were not made as well as others.  However, the 6 I got were just fine.  No workmanship flaws that I can find.  My wife immediately washed them and dried them in the normal manner to make sure they would hold their, as much as possible, their size and shape.  I ordered XL to make sure that shrinkage would keep them wearable and that was accomplished.  I like these shirts, they are not too heavy nor too light weight - just about right for me.  And, for the price, I think it was a great deal and outstanding value.", "These are NOT official Hanes Comfortsoft T-shirt\u2019s. I received plain white shirts made of a scratchy material that say \u201cHanes\u201d and \u201cMade in Haiti\u201d but have no other info; laundry instructions etc. I posted a photo of an actual Comfortsoft shirt that I have and then a photo of what was sent to me.", "I learned the hard way that \"Comfortsoft\" is simply a name, it's NOT a description - this is what earns a 1-star. In addtion to that, I made a mistake in branding. I order the \"Hanes's Nano Premium\" shirts and LOVED THEM- they are very soft and comfortable - so I came back to order more soft and comfortable shirts and I saw this deal has 5 in the pack (the other only has two, so i have to order two and only get 4 in the order) but this package of 5, I stand to get a 5th shirt for only two more dollars! - It was all good until  I received the order in the mail and these shirts are VERY rough and scratchy. So the lesson is just order the Nano Premium shirts - and \"so what\" I have to add more orders of the Nano Premium shirts to the shopping cart, there is no real cost savings by ordering this package of cheap scratchy shirts.

Much more comfortable for colder weather.  Doesn't pinch under the arms or in the sleeve. Hard to find the \"Red Tag\" Hanes.", "I bought a size 3x first, but they were way too small. Even before laundering. More like a Large. So I bought these 4x and they fit like a 3x so perfect for my guy. Not too long, not too short. Not too thin but not too thick. Fabric is perfect for him. So I know now to go one size up with Hanes T-shirt\u2019s.", "Really disappointed that the third party seller that Amazon dealt with in this case had the nerve to sell me bootleg fake Hanes tshirts. They fit alright but not to Hanes standards.  You can tell that the shirts are made with crap materials that will more than likely shrink after washing and I'll be using them for rags. I'll enjoy them for as long as I can and when the time comes use them as all purpose tags. Quite disappointing."]},

They tightened around the neck, arms, and I lost about two inches of length. Now, I have to wear my pants up high to avoid a crop-top look (trust me, no one wants that). Plus, they faded almost instantly. Next to the 3 year-old black Fruit of the Loom shirts they were supposed to replace they look almost gray.

For several years I used Hanse Premium, which did great the first few years, but it seems that something must have changed over the past couple of years, because they seem to have lost the quality that they once had, shrinking in length too much.  I then tried two different types of Jockey.  Again, some seemed to be dependable, while others shrunk way too much.  So, in my search for a tee that would be long enough I stumbled across these again.  I am 6'2'' and about 245.  I do like my tees on the long side...so that they stay tucked in.  I purchased XLT...the \"T\" meaning \"Tall\" so that I would have the extra length.Pros:-After several washes, they have pretty much maintained their length.  They stay tucked in.-Very durable.Cons:-I have not found any yet.Note:  These are thicker than normal tees.  So, if you want something thin, this is not the tee for you.  If you want something of good, durable quality, then this is the tee for you.Would I purchase these again?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, I have placed a couple of more orders since these first two orders.", "I ordered size 3XLT. I have many 3XLT t-shirts and know that is the right size for me. This shirt is for a very slim big guy. I can get it around me and I have a little room, but it feels restrictive and the fabric will probably shrink even more. It is also extremely long, even for a tall size. This shirt, in size 3XLT, is probably perfect for someone around 6'8\" and around 220 lbs.", "I have ordered these shirts many times before and wear them quite often, they fit well and feel really comfortable. Ordered two more of the same product as before and they are not the same shirt. Not only do they not fit, the feel of the fabric and shape of the shirt is very wrong. Also with the poor quality Ive noticed the label on the inside is not the same as the other shirts so this leads to believe this is a knock off.", "This 2 pack was a great value.

I first bought a different brand, and was unhappy with the flimsy fabric, so I ordered these. Boy, am I glad I did! The fit and the fabric are perfect. These will hold up after many washings, unlike the thin fabric of the other brand. These cost a bit more, but they were well worth it.", "The blue shirts fit nicely and are made of a nice, thick material. But the seams where the underarm meets the body of the shirt are weak. After only one washing they started to split open, and now I have holes directly where my underarms are. This happened to both of the blue shirts I received. I've also ordered black shirts in the past and this happened to them as well. However, this does not seem to be a problem with the white or gray shirts, which I ordered at the same time as these blue ones and have not shown any signs of splitting. They seem to be made of a thinner material as well. My guess would be that the more heavily dyed shirts use a thicker material and cheaper sewing around certain areas. If having holes that show your armpits doesn't bother you, then these shirts will be perfect for you."]},
{"asin": "B00B6E7GL0", "comments": ["I want to start our by saying that I am, in general, happy with both the quality of the product and the timeliness of the delivery.I used to buy Champion tee shirts ;with featured a decent weight fabric and a generous cut.  A few years back Champion was bought out by Fruit of the Loom and the fabric got lighter, and the cut got skimpy--now resembling the Fruit of the Loom tee shirts.I then switched to Dickies (regular weight) which I can buy at Walmart.  It featured an even heavier fabric and an even more generous cut than the Champion tees of old.  I am happy with the Dickies standard weight tees.  But Walmart carries them in on black, white and gray only.  I wanted colors.I ordered the Dickies heavy weight. When it arrived I tossed it in the laundry along with a brand new Dickies standard weight.  When they were laundered I handled both and they did not feel much different.  I examined the construction and they appear to be the same quality (excellent).  The heavy weight was made in Nicaragua, and the standard weight was produced in the Honduras.  But both seem of similar assembly quality.I decided to weigh them on my kitchen scale:  Stardard weight (XL) 9.25 ounces; Heavy weight (XL) 9.75 ounces a difference of 1/2 ounce (5.26%).  Hardly a heavy weight.So if you are not interested in colors, I recommend the standard weight; if you want the colors go with the heavy weight.If you want a true heavy weight tee I only know of Duluth Trading whose tees are of a true heavy weight fabric and the cut is generous but the product is expensive.  I find the Dickies to be a much better value.  For tall men, the Dickies are available in a \"tall\" too.A good product, but not really a heavy weight.", "The Dickies Men's Short Sleeve Heavyweight Crew Nick t-shirts are great! We ordered in 6 different colors. I know this might sound crazy but husband and I have been searching for the past 3+ years for t-shirts that would meet the following basic criteria:1. Heavy Weight Cotton2. Will survive going through the washer more than a dozen times.3. Minimal shrinkage after washing/drying4. Not See-Through -- no secondary shirt needed5. Little to no graphics6. Tag-lessThe Dickies t-shirts exceeded our expectations. The t-shirts are the thickness of the cotton that used to be the norm in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's.  Most t-shirt companies have made the cotton thinner, and thinner and thinner. To the point the men might start wearing man bra's. The Dickies t-shirts do not have obnoxious graphics added (which is also hard to find). The front pock contains a small Dickies logo. Another positive, the inside back neck is \"tag-less\".We like these t-shirts so much, that I'm tempted to order another dozen or two for upcoming years.", "I love these shirts. I now own around 12 in various darker colors. They are great fitting and nicely made. The material is indeed thicker than usual, yet not heavy or stifling in heat. They do have two problems, however: 1) The colors fade, and some of them do so very quickly. Gray seems to hold up best. Green and brown are losing a lot of color saturation with every single wash. 2) These things are oil STAIN MAGNETS. You may not notice anything while wearing them or doing the laundry, but later, it's not uncommon to take a \"clean\" one off the hanger and notice a few spots, then throw it right into the hamper. None of my other shirts do this, from cheap 100% cotton tees to poly blends.For both of these problems, I'm only knocking off one star because I really do love these shirts otherwise. There must be something that other manufacturers are doing to protect their fabric, but Dickies is not. For now, I'm keeping a bottle of\u00a0Grandma's Secret GS7001 Laundry Spray, 16-Ounce\u00a0near the washing machine. I've found it works fairly well. Usually.", "I'm 6.2 and 205 and don't like short sleeves crowding into my armpit, so I normally go up a size so that my shoulder seam drops over the side of my upper arm by an inch or so. In this case I took the suggestions about going up a size again due to these running small?So XL normally works and I like the shirt tail to be longer so I want to tuck them in and they will stay put!Based on the reviews here, I ordered the 2XLT, so when these arrive the seam between the upper part of the sleeves and the shoulder rides just over the top of my shoulder, but the sleeve are still a bit short by 3/4 to even a full inch. They had a bit better fit before washing and I don't use a dryer for most of my cloths. Anyway, I'm keeping the shirts, the collar seems to be well made and keep it's shape so that's important as well.Note: Shirts from another order were made in Pakistan and were not stated as being \"heavyweight\" shirts.they feel about the same (a bit softer maybe) and yet the fitting is better with about 1/2 in more sleeve than ones from this order, which were made Nicaragua? Laying both out seam to seam and the sleeve on the Pakistan was a bit longer than those from Nicaragua, both shirts had been washed twice!IMO - the material that is being used today vs. the past are not going to hold up as well as shirts from late 80's and early 90's which in my case held up well past 20 years or more and many were made in the USA.", "Possibly the best crew neck T I've owned.  Love the fit. Its comfortable, and the collar doesn't loosen after a day of working in it. There is a WORLD of difference between these and the standard Gildan/Hanes tees available at Walmart or similar stores. I'll never go back to a traditional tee after owning these heavyweight ones. It's also much better than the Pro Club brand, which was highly recommended by a couple guys I work with. I actually wear these out daily while getting groceries or doing other things because I like them so much.", "The Dickie's Men's short sleeve shirts are perfect for my husband! Here is a picture of him in the Orange color, which is great for his job. The shirts are heavy weight material and they hold up nicely for a long time.  He is 6'2\" and about 195 lbs.

I'm dissapointed.  First, if your a big guy, NFL, lumberjack, you'll probably love this shirt.  I'm 5'11, 165 lbs, career military.  This fits me nice in the shoulders and chest, but hangs like a dress around my middle, because there is NO shape or form fitting.  I could live with that.  Wouldn't be the first shirt made for larger people that I have to have tailored to fit me below the chest, but here's the real kicker.  There's something about the design of the sleeves and the weight of the fabric that causes the whole shirt to lift up and bunch around the chest and neck if I lift my arms up shoulder height or higher.  That's definitely something you don't want in a T-Shirt that is supposed to be soft and comfortable.  This cotton is pretty stiff.  Maybe after a few washes it'll be softer, but it seems like a fairly stiff weave.  It certainly doesn't hang/drape like the pictures shown.  Lastly, the pocket, as shown in the picture, wraps around the side of the chest and is largely useless except for keeping a pen in.  It does have a separate little pen spot in the pocket, but the opening is too small to use most modern pens with a rubberized grip.  So, all in all, pretty disappointing for me.", "I bought these in a 2X and a 2X tall to see which would fit best. I am going to stick with the 2X tall. I am 5 foot 10 230 pounds. These are made with heavy material and they help conceal my fire arm when it\u2019s on my hip. In fact these are the only T-shirts I will buy from here on out. I have bought one in every color both in a short sleeve and long sleeve. What you need to know about the two. The longsleeve ones tend to be a little longer at the hip and the sleeves hang a little long (remember I order tall) it take a little time to shrink up to the proper length. The non tall long sleeve was a little short on me after washing several times.", "I like these shirts very much but it depends. I buy the 2XT shirts. I buy the tall because when I bend over, I don\u2019t have any offensive backside views to contend with. It seems the shirts are made in two different geographic locations. Mexico and Pakistan.  The Mexican made shirts have the horse shoe logo on them and the Pakistan shirts have a more traditional logo on them. The Mexican shirts fit well till after you wash and dry them. Then, the sleeves don\u2019t cover up the bicep area well and the tall becomes meaningless.  The Pakistani made shirts are the total opposite. They hold their shape and stay true to being tall after many multiple washes and drying. I think the company that owns the Dickie products needs to ditch the Mexican manufacturer and give all their business to Pakistan. I hate to say that as an American but when you\u2019re paying the same amount for both and one is completely more superior than the other; it is what it is."]},

Love 'em.", "I've been buying these shirts for decades, and they've been a reliable lightweight undershirt. The only problem I've ever had with them is they shrink just a tiny bit every time you wash them in hot water, so they become too small before they wear out. But for the price that's a perfectly acceptable problem to have.However, this year I bought 3 six packs of these shirts, and they're all trash. They've reduced the amount of cotton they use to the point they're nearly see-through. The quality control is non-existent, as each package of shirts seems to be made from a different pattern. One package, the shirts were too short. Another package, the sleeves were too short. The last package, the sleeves were too narrow. I've washed these shirts twice, and already half of them have shrunk to an entirely different size while the other half haven't, and two of the eighteen shirts have already torn at the V.I will never buy these shirts again.", "I'm 5'8\" and about 160. Bought the Medium as per the size chart. These shirts (I bought the 6-pack) fit perfectly, the shoulder seams match up to my shoulder, the v allows me to wear dress shirts with the top (non-collar) button unbuttoned without showing any white, and the length allows the shirt to remain tucked all day. Quality is standard for undershirts; not too thin as to see through but not too thick as to add bulk and heat.", "I've bought 3-4 pack of these T-shirt! Previously, for many years I was wearing the A-type shirt or muscle shirt only. Over the years, I've noticed that my dress shirt, which I  wear daily to work, were wearing out at the armpits.  Yes, the arm pits stain were destroying my pricey dress shirt.  No amount of deodorant/antiperspirant was helpful. I had to throw away so many because no amount of washing can get rid of the stains. Finally, I decided to ditch the A-shirt and switch to full T-shirt as my undershirt and haven't look back. These shirts aren't fancy, they feels like normal T-shirt, and are comfortable. I wear these 100% of the time now. It had certainly saved me money over the years because I don't have to replace my dress shirt nearly as often.

The shirts were way too big, x-large maybe even xx, it says on the shirts its a large.  Put it through first wash and wear it, the shirt shrunk at least two sizes.  They still dont conform to my body right, look messy and untidy and look very cheap.  There are six shirts in the package, I'll probably wear them two or three times and throw them out.", "All 6 Hanes T-Shirts arrived well packaged, clean and were the correct size.I ordered a set of medium, and tried one before washing. The fit was exactly like a medium t-shirt would fit me. After washing the set, I feel like they shrunk by a very small amount. They still fit really well.The material feels nice and soft, not too thick, and not too thin. My primary use for these are as undershirts, and they are comfortable in this regard (a combination of having no tags, the right thickness, the right length and fitting snugly). They are a bit longer than normal medium t-shirts (at least those that I currently own), but this helps them to stay tucked in during the day - at least for persons like me, who don't do a lot of stretching and other stuff that would ensure your shirt gets untucked.I'd recommend these to anyone looking for undershirts.", "Nice white V neck undershirts.  Does what they're supposed to - collects sweat and preserves the shirt worn over top.  They are tagless, which is all I will buy.  I can't stand tags.  V is deep enough that I can leave polo shirts or dress shirts unbuttoned enough to keep me cool, but keep the undershirt hidden - shows just the right amount of classic chest hair.I find after about 25 washes, they're starting to turn grey - but I don't think I've found one that doesn't.  Did not count how many washes before they turned grey, but it's been about 3-4 months, average about 1 wear per week.  They're not super expensive either - around $12 for 6 - so once they turn grey and start to collect deodorant/sweat stains, I just pack them up and donate them to charity.  I figure it's better than throwing them out - I let the charity decide if they want to clothe someone with my old stinky shirt or let them go cold!", "I have some Hanes T-shirts that have seen their better day. Thought I would buy more on Amazon instead of a local store. Received the package and was disappointed with the weight of the T-shirts. Pretty thin. My older versions were a bit thicker.

Now having washed the undershirts, they shrunk in width and length. If I had to guess, there was easily 10% shrinkage had practically no shrinkage with recently purchased undershirts from Jockey).  So... if they fit well before washing, they now are a little tight (tolerable but snug) but the length really shrunk.  I was first able to tuck the undershirt in and not have them bunch up during normal daily activities.  Now, because of the shrinkage, the undershirt bunches up after normal daily activities  and gives the appearance your shirt doesn't fit right (also a little uncomfortable).

But keep in mind that none leave you feeling like you haven't sweat.  Don't expect a dry shirt after the workout - if you put in the work, you will get these soaked.  With that said I love the feel, how it hangs (never grabs the skin, even when wet), and the light weight.  I regularly choose these style shirts over cotton.  I wear them alone - no undershirt.  I've chosen this brand twice, and the big/tall 2xl (I'm 6'4\", 260lbs, 3-5-mile runner most days) covers nicely whether I'm working abs, running or raising weights above my head - I never have to worry about the shirt being too short.

I have to wear undershirts to work, and I've had a hard time consistently finding comfortable shirts with a good cotton-poly blend. All-cotton shirts always end up with stretched out necks, looking saggy, etc. These shirts are absolutely perfect.

There are small tags in the neck, which initially upset me, but as I went to cut them out, they pull out with minimal tension, almost as if they're stuck on with velcro instead of sewn.

I have other Next Level shirts in small which fit me perfectly, not tight at all.The V-Neck is also so large it goes down past my chest. This shirt fits horribly and they don't do returns so I'm SOL. I'm guessing they shipped a women's shirt, since it looks nothing like what others have posted. I'll change my review if they make up for it.", "I love these shirts, they are soft and hold up well after washings with no color fade or shrinking.

I'm fat around my belly area and needed a shirt that had the hang style in the back so my butt crack wasn't showing all the time. Yeah I could lose the weight, but now that I found this shirt (and I plan to buy more) no weight lose for me!!! And my man boobs don't show to much in this shirt either. Only when my nipples get hard, but hey, what woman doesn't love to see some nipple action on a man! Am I right? Or am I right?", "This is a great quality shirt and has a good color too (burgundy). The only problem is how far the back flap goes. The front flap is at a great length but the back flap goes down pass my butt and looks like I'm trying to pull off a half dress piece.  So I recommend this shirt to talk guys and I think girls could pull this off just get the smallest model.", "Hello athleisure shirt! I've been trying to get these specific designed of shirts for a reasonable price, unlike those sold by YouTubers and other fitness-community fam like Gymsharks or Alphalete. I was skeptic at first in terms of fit since I've never worn clothes that is designed like this so I went for my 2 types of sizes that I would normally wear: my regular size of Large and also a Medium to see how it fits. Overall, both fits me well out of the bag/fresh from delivery (more on that later). I'm 5'8\" and 177 lbs. As you can see by the picture, I'm not too muscular nor overweight, just a good mixture of fatness and muscle--roughly 20% - 21% body fat. Anyway, I am wearing a MEDIUM here and my arms are hugging the sleeves and so is my pecs (chest) and it's nicely tapered down and shapes my lower body/waist area. Now for the large, I didn't take a picture, but basically it's almost the same minus the sleeves not hugging my arms as much and also it's slightly longer. BUT I washed and machine dried both of them right away like I would for any of my clothes and both the large and medium shrank a tiny bit, though not enough to make it unwearable. Overall, these are great and fits as expected not only for outing but also wearing it at the gym. I love my first 2 pairs that I instantly ordered some more since, why not? The price is right and it makes anyone out there refresh their looks by having a versatile and stylish shirt in or out of the gym!Note: you dont' necessarily need to be a gym goer to wear these by the way. Anybody can wear it, plus it makes you stand out of the crowd since the design of the shirt is not very common unlike your regular t-shirt or v-neck!", "Really good nice product", "I bought an XL in this because a men's XL usually leave me plenty of room to wash and dry without too much shrinkage.  Since I had never bought this brand before, I washed it in cold water and hung it up to dry - no heat ever touched this shirt!  Not only did it shrink a little in the chest, it shrunk considerably in length.  Before washing, I had extra room in the chest and it was long enough to cover my rear end.  After, it's a little snug across the chest and only comes halfway down my rear end.  I would recommend sizing up at least 2 sizes if you want to have some room after washing.", "I read reviews before buying this shirt and saw that it is a little thin and the stiching is not the best. I figured still worth a shot for the cost. I was plesantly surprised. The shirt i got was not as thin as i had imagined it is still thin but also soft and comfy. It did shrink a little after first two washes but again i expected that. The stiching is light and can easily be ripped but again for the cost this is not as bad as i expected. I got the 2xl and im 6 foot 2 280lbs with a large chest. I was worried the bottom of the shirt would be clingy but it actually fits really well. I was hoping for a little longer so i may go up a size on the next one but only for length reasons.", "Update: I just ordered a second one in white to replace the first one that I got which was sewed crooked. This one is a completely different fit and length. It is way longer than the first one I had and a little slimmer throughout. I wish it fit as nicely as the first one minus the defect. I won't be ordering another one of these. I'm very disappointed, I feel like I'm wearing a nightgown with this one.Original review:This shirt fits perfectly. I really love the way it hangs. Unfortunately, I'm giving it 3 stars for the poor quality control. The shirt was sewed crooked and the scalloped bottom was totally asymmetrical, off to one side. The seams on each side were in two completely different places. One side seemed to be in the correct spot, while the other side was clear around on the side of my back! Fortunately, Amazon refunded me. I'm reluctant to order another white one and have the same issue be happening, despite how much I loved the fit of the shirt.I also ordered the charcoal grey colored shirt in the same size and it fits entirely differently. It's much longer and more narrow. It felt and looked too tight for me. I had to return it.Perhaps I'll get the nerve to order another white one soon and fingers crossed that it will be symetrical.", "Awesome fit, long, just what I needed.Helps conceal my firearms as I have a longer torso and my normal shirts pop over my firearm.Quality is really really nice, should last a long time.Fits even better once washer.Neck is slightly larger (one star drop) but I did learn they have a premium version which corrects this.Anyways for the price these are amazing.", "I love these shirts. I ordered 3 of the olive drab color in size large ( I'm 6', 200lbs, athletic build). After reading some of the other reviews, the first thing I did was look for defects and check that they were all the same size. These are about as thick as a fruit of the loom under shirt (basic white tee) and you cannot see through them. At least in the color I bought. I normally buy the Bella + Canvas long body tee but wanted some color besides black, white, and grey. Comparing the two, these are shorter and thinner but you don't have to pull them up to sit down, they don't interfere with your movement. They cover your rear and fit really well.", "The quality completely depends on what color you get. White/Grey 100% cotton so even when washing on the coldest setting they will still shrink about half in size. Maroon/Dark grey is a softer polyester hybrid. Stays soft and doesn\u2019t shrink. Have about 6 of these shirts, just wish they were more consistent."]},

I ordered Large and the v neck is much larger than what is in the photo.", "Mine are not bad, especially when you get 6 for $12.  A slight bit rough right out of the package but fine after the first wash, which I do with all new clothing.  They are on the cheaper made/materials side but again not bad for the price.  Good work shirt.  I'm satisfied with the purchase.", "In general, I\u2019m a picky shopper in terms of quality, but when it comes to undershirts, I only need something of decent quality but at a good price.As a point of reference, for my own use, three Calvin Klein v-neck undershirts at Costco for $19.99 cost more than what I felt was necessary for me (they are definitely of better quality though).So I found these Gildans and gave them a try.  The fact that they cost less than $2 per undershirt worried me so I wasn't expecting much, but they are actually better than expected, given the very reasonable price!  I laundered them once before wearing one, and my initial impression is that they fit great (I ordered Medium size, and I\u2019m a size 39 chest &amp; 33 waist) and are of very acceptable quality considering the price.I then compared them to some old Costco Kirkland V-neck T-Shirts that I\u2019ve had for a very long time.  These Gildans are a lighter thinner cotton, so their durability wash after wash remains to be seen, but I initially have absolutely no complaints for the price.The Gildan cotton definitely feels rougher than the Kirklands, but not enough to prevent me from buying more Gildans for the price. The stitching on the Gildans is not as smooth or refined as the Kirkland\u2019s, but again totally acceptable given the price point.In the end, as long as you aren\u2019t shopping for premium quality, IMHO I feel this is a very good deal on a set of 6 acceptable quality undershirts, and I found them even better than expected.  If durability holds up after a reasonable amount of washes, I definitely plan to buy these again.", "I'd heard of\u00a0Gildan Platinum Men's 6-Pack Ringspun Arch Black Ankle Sock, Black, Sock Size: 10-13/Shoe Size:9-11\u00a0before, but I wasn't aware that they made t-shirts and boxer briefs, too.These are very comfortable and so far they're holding their shape well.", "I bought this for my husband.

I guess you get what you pay for.  Day 1 they came in and the first one I put on has a hole in the arm seam where it was not stitched properly.  I guess I should have paid the extra $1 or $2 extra for the Hanes or Fruit of the Loom.  I have not checked the other 5 but I'm not very confident these will last. I will write another review if they end up lasting but I'm guessing Gildan is not going to send me a replacement so I recommend just spending the extra buck for a better brand.", "Love these shirts and the price for 5 is great.

They fit OK but being as thin as they are, I wonder if they will hold up...Colors were also  a little off from what I expected, but that could be because of my laptop screen coloration.  The violet color is especially lighter than pictured.  I was really looking for something like the Costco Peru shirts in other colors.", "Pretty good as basic shirts go. They cover all the important bits, the material feels nice, and the stitches seem to be strong and good quality. I've washed them about 20 times now, and they haven't shrunk much in the torso region. The arms, however, seem to shrink a little more than the rest of the shirt. Still, for cheap shirts to wear hiking and camping I'd say they work really well. I like the earth tone color pack.

Lastly, the fit is a \"standard\" fit, not that body hugging \"fitted\" crap that all shirts seem to be nowadays. For us guys with the \"Dad bods\", these shirts hang nicely and hide the guts, jelly rolls and man boobs that we've worked so hard to aquire over the years. I'll be buying plenty more of these shirts in the future! HIGHLY recommended.", "I usually buy white tshirts by Jockey for my husband as undershirts for his dress clothing, which he wears 5 days a week to work. Needless to say, we've used many brands over the years. I decided to try these this time I purchased his white tees based on the reviews and the price. I did go one size up from his usual size (Large) to an XLarge based on a few reviews regarding sizing. They fit perfectly. Not too big anywhere. They're not super tight around the neck like some under shirts can be, which drives my husband nuts. They are very soft right out of the packaging and haven't lost that softness with multiple times through the washer and dryer. I don't use fabric softener. I use wool balls as a natural fabric softener. So no chemical is being used to keep them soft. That's a plus for me because it means it's quality fabric.I actually purchased 3 white tshirts by Jockey at the same time I purchased these. I washed them all. Dried them all. Folded them all mixed together and placed them in a stack. I could see the difference. These are a bit thinner than the Jockeys. They aren't quite as white as Jockey. The sizing was nearly exactly the same as a Jockey Large. I wanted to see if my husband noticed a difference. He didn't!I've had these a few weeks now. They launder just fine. If there has been shrinkage it's been minimal and not noticeable. They still look brand new. Of course, in time I know they will wear out. All under shirts do when they are used as frequently as my husband must wear them. However, I'm pleased with them. My husband hasn't complained about them and trust me he WOULD complain if the shirts didn't feel right or fit correctly.I do think Jockey is a better quality overall, but I would buy these again. I do think they will break down sooner than the Jockey tees due to the thin material they're made of and the fact that these tshirts are worn, waged and dried A LOT. However, I would still recommend them. They are good quality and will last someone else a long time if they aren't been worn almost daily. This is a great deal for two quality white tshirts.**I would consider sizing up one size.**", "Finally a basic black tshirt in size medium that is long enough ! At 6' 2\" and 175lbs,  with a 33\" waist and 37\" chest, this tshirt has a few inches of free space in the chest and is fairly snug at the hips, which is fine given most of my other mediums (other brands) are a bit too short on me. Material is soft. Will wrinkle if you dont take it out of dryer asap but thats on me not the shirt. Recommend !", "I like these t shirts quite a bit, enough that I bought eight of them so far. The material is just the right thickness - it's definitely a t shirt, not an undershirt, though it will serve both purposes. I bought the XL and found they fit really well and have held up to multiple washings. Since I'm in a part of the country where t shirt weather can be year-round, these get a lot of wear. My only concern is it seems like the selection has dramatically decreased to the point I'm thinking Amazon has discontinued them. I hope that's not the case as these are quality shirts at a good price.", "The t-shirt is very nice quality. But the size is too big. I brought the medium size and it is more than 4-6 inches bigger than the comparable medium t-shirt from other brands.

I'd rather wear a shirt a little too big than one that's too small. I think large would be just right. I love the softness of the cotton, and the color is beautiful.

I, on the other hand, am happy with it for the following reasons: thick material, sturdy, well sewn and put together, it cleans  well without remaining stained ( we had issues with work shirts that absorb every tiny speck of dust and then does not come off when washed), and it fits well on the body (although this one a bit too large). By the way, it doesn't shrink when washed. As a result, the husband demanded one  size Small. It is yet to come.

People today are absorbed in their I phones and I figure this shirt could save your remaining days on the earth by just a spilt second earlier difference of being seen.  The only downside of this shirt for me is as a long distance bike rider you encounter whacked out homeless drug users that are highly paranoid.  Its hard to get away from anyone stalking you.  The unforeseen problem for me was while it is great for safety it also attracts the kooks and then you have the problem of making it hard on yourself to evade them.  There are a lot of nuts out there that think everything is a conspiracy and this shirt color will get their attention. If you are not putting 10k miles per year on your bike you will probably not have my situation.  I was wearing safety vest before I discovered these shirts for hot summer days.

The collar on this shirt is non-existent (See Pics).  The  I am 6'2\" and 270lbs (I like to think all muscle but I am kidding myself) and the old shirts fit perfectly.  I do have some in the 2XLT and I like those even better.  Either way, they were just great shirts and I wanted more.  I mean, for an $8 shirt is is just \"OK\" and doesn't fit anything like the old shirts.  It isn't as long..  I wouldn't have bought it had I seen it in person but I will keep it.  It is that new stretchy and polyester feeling \"Cotton\" that I am not a fan of.  Maybe, I was just disappointed that this shirt was not like the ones I hoped to replace.  I did however, order multiple brands with this order so I will review them, too.", "So I ordered dozens of the different Champion shirts on Prime day (in black and grey) because I like the fit. I did notice that Amazon has multiple product listings for these shirts that look almost identical, but not quite if you look closely at the images and the product titles. I ended up ordering a bunch of both since I didn't know what the difference would be.So the cotton for this particular Champion Jersey is so much softer than the cotton for the other, almost identical, Champion Jersey on Amazon. This one is titled \"Champion Men's Classic Jersey T-Shirt\" and notice it has the Champion emblem on the front that is darkened to match the shirt color. There's also another brightly colored Champion emblem on the side of the sleeve for this shirt. Again this shirt is super soft cotton.The other Champion shirt on Amazon titled \"Champion Men's Jersey T-Shirt\" that has much rougher cotton is the one with brightly colored emblem on the front. It fits and looks good, but the cotton on it is much more rough and abrasive. Here's the link to it (rough cotton one):https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EG81U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Champion Men's Jersey T-Shirt, BlackKeep in mind, I only ordered black and light grey from each of the two product types so I can't say if they'll all be this soft, but these colors are definitely softer than the black and grey shirts from the other product listing on Amazon. Definitely go with these if you like soft cotton.", "These fit as expected until washed and then they shrank. I've been buying Champion Ts for a long time and the latest batch I bought does not measure up to the quality of ones I bought previously. These are very thin, they had a lot of loose threads hanging on them and one already has a hole in the underarm (may have been from a loose thread that I cut off). If you are expecting them to be similar to ones you ordered a year or so ago, you will be disappointed in both the quality and workmanship. I won't be ordering these anymore.", "Like many men's clothing manufacturers today, these folks have given the public less than what is expected, or at least what I expected and has caused me problems.  It appears that the current trend is to reduce the actual SIZE of the garment while keeping the POSTED SIZE you expected the same ... in other words, what WAS  X-Large a year or so ago, NOW appears to be a Large shirt but is marked as X-Large.  Yes I am a bigger guy and wear X-Large shirts, but now I have to buy 2X shirts, because they are the \"NEW XL\". When I ordered this shirt, I anticipated the problem and ordered 2 XL, but even it was too small.To check things out, so you don't think I've hit the pasta too much, I've laid the new shirts over similar shirts bought  before, and there are actual dimension difference, even though the shirt is marked the same size as bought before.  Try it yourself and see if that's an issue for you.", "Size is slightly small out of the package.. Shrinks another size and a half in the first wash...Material is very thin only slightly better than the cheap T's at Sam's Club...Don't waste your money...", "I first discovered Champion T-Shirts at our local Sam's Club over a decade ago. Over the years, they have proved more durable and free from shrinkage than those of the more prominent brands, like Hanes and Fruit. I'm happy to have located them again on amazon.com, and to find them every bit as high in quality as those of the past. In fact, I'm wearing one now.", "Fit was fine at first (size XL), but after a single wash - on normal with cold water this shrank 1 1/2 sizes and is now between a medium and large (same with the other 3 colors I bought, so it isn't just this one shirt/color). My old Champion and Russell shirts that I washed and dried at the same time are still true to size. Extremely disappointed. will see if its possible to return as in my opinion this is most definitely a defective product.", "Tee shirts are much flimsier than I expected, but they will be okay for work.They don't make them like They used to ! I'm 5' 9'' tall and weigh just under 200 lbs. The X- Large fit well. They are (according to label) all cotton, but they don'thave the 'nice cotton' feel to them like My old ones have. Again, okay for work, and okay for the price.", "I purchased six of these shirts and have bought eight more of these previously. My review is for all the shirts in this order. In my opinion, Champion makes the best of these kind of shirts. They hold their shape and color well and last a long time. They are perfect for work shirts and simply to work out. Soft and lightweight, they can be worn for any casual situation and you don't overheat in them during the summer. They are the best everyday tee shirts for the money.", "After a single wash the stitching was coming loose around the right arm as well as down around the bottom of the shirt.  It was a little small but I kept it anyway but now after a single wash it is literally falling apart.  I wear several different Champion products and like the brand but this shirt which is made is Honduras is a low quality product.  I have noticed that sweat pants I have ordered vary a little in how they fit, but they seem to be well made and they are made in El Salvador.  Stay away from these shirts!"]},
{"asin": "B00KBZQ1T8", "comments": ["This is a review for all Hanes Nano shirts in general (I have maybe 10-20 of them).If you wear them fresh out of the box, they're great - I really have no complaints. You'll think they're so great, in fact, that you'll probably order another 10-15 in various colors just to have around.Unfortunately, after washing them 1-3 times, they've become unwearable for me. They shrink somewhat noticeably (it's not insane, but they became tight enough that I don't want to wear them anymore), and they ride up like crazy around your back. I'm not sure how, but if I'm sitting or lying down, or even biking, I'll need to adjust the shirt every at least 10-20 minutes because it will have managed to fold up 2-3 times around my waist. This might have something to do with the fit (though I doubt that's the only issue), but it makes these pretty much unwearable for me unless I know I'm going to be standing or walking around all day.I also dislike the arms on these - they flare out like crazy, and I don't think it could possibly look good unless you've got really big biceps (I don't). Personally, I didn't notice this until I got another shirt to compare it to, but it really sticks out to me now (and not in a good way). A few of them have also had long threads start coming out (especially around the sleeves), though this doesn't bother me as much.I've recently started switching to Next Level shirts and they're amazing in comparison - they're noticeably softer, the sleeves are much better fitting and they never ride up. If you decide to buy Hanes shirts, I urge you to seriously consider getting one of the Next Level shirts for comparison (they cost roughly the same amount). I can't imagine anyone preferring these shirts.", "I am allergic to polyester and specifically bought these shirts because they said 100% cotton.  They arrived with a tag that says 90% cotton and 10% polyester.  False advertising!", "Not real happy with the T-Shirts, wrinkle easily, very flimsy, not holding up well with just a few washings.  Still looking for the equivalent of that Russell T shirt that I bought almost a decade ago.  Paid a high price for it but it has held up so well it still looks good.  I will wager it will look better in another 3 months than these nano t shirts will.  I can't get a Russelll to hold up as well lately either and  I have tried many brands looking for a good T.  Carhartt is great but they are heavy for the summer.  Probably have to go with buying cheap cotton tees at wally world and just using them for cleaning rags after a few monthsStarted throwing these away, something I'll do only as a last resort... they are shrinking and don't look good and fit weird....Hanes....never again!", "I really don't get the few poor reviews.....if they fell apart, obvious flook quality control issue. The problems ref quality, come on!!!!Two shirts for $8.69. However, I got to say that I have purchased a lot more expensive T shirts that didn't feel as good as these, and these look just as good. I work outside and go through a lot of T shirts due to dirt grime, etc. This is the perfect shirt, but I gotta say I have no problem wearing them casually either. Washed three times and have had no damage and remove them after drying and no wrinkles. Guess if you store your clothes in the dryer like I  do form time to time, you may have some wrinkles.If your looking for an inexpensive t shirt that looks good and holds up, don't hesitate.", "Second time buying these. They are cut a little (like, a little, not slim-fit) slimmer, and they are a few inches longer than most regular Ts. They also shrink, especially around the arm hole, which causes the sleeve to flair out, and fold up with any arm movement. After a while, the neck will sag.Here's the deal: I use these as sleep/lounge shirts. For this purpose, they're great! I'm a cold sleeper; I'm very sensitive to air movement around my legs and bottom. the longer length means the shirts don't ride up and expose my bottom to the cold air; in fact, I wish they were a little longer. Now, I can't sleep in anything else.They are soft and comfortable - not too thick, not too thin. If I have to go out and grab something from the mailbox, or take the dog out, I can, it just looks like I have a lived-in T on, and not pajamas. For this purpose, I recommend.", "I needed 100% cotton which the ad on Amazon specifically says that it is 100% cotton.  But when I received it, turns out it is actually 10% polyester...which may not seem like a big deal but I was planning to use iron-on logos.  When I ironed on the first logo, it all melted together because of the polyester.  Please correct the ad!!!", "The fit is as expected. I also like its thickness, not too thick and not too thin. However, the quality control is abysmal (this word reminds me the scene in which Joey Tribbiani from Friends was happy about the review saying his acting skill is abysmal.) After first wash, it falls apart. Don't buy unless your skill to patch clothes is not abysmal.", "I really love these shirts. I can't believe they are this inexpensive. I'm the type of person who can't wear a shirt if it's even slightly \"itchy.\" These are super soft and fit well. They have a nice modern cut to them with shorter, fitted sleeves and a slim torso. They have a nice length to them which makes it easier to tuck them in if you're wearing them as an undershirt, but not so long that they look odd when wearing them alone.", "This shirt is so nicely colored.  It does not have the faded blue look you might expect with some blue shirts, but has that very excellent coloring of something well made.

Washed them on the usual settings, \"low\" temp wash, \"normal\" temp dry, but after that first run these shirts are VERY tight. So tight, that they are not wearable for me.

They also are thin material and not quality at all like original authentic ralph lauren. They come with fake tags produced by some mark down company, and do not come with official blue and gold ralph lauren sale tags. Also they do not come in the original Polo By Ralph Lauren silver and blue bags. They come in a after market clear regular bag. These also lack the official stitching of real authentic Ralph Lauren shirts, you can not see the stitching around the collar, arm, or waist. This material is more like a Hanes undershirt and they are manufactured in unusual countries that Ralph Lauren does not list on its site. If you pay attention to the shirts and take time to examine you can see they are fake. The ponys on the shirt also are slightly different, there is excess stitch that is rough and goes across the legs instead of going behind. Also if you flip the shirt inside out you can see it is a regular shirt because they left the white shirt tags on the inside, and the tags have different locations and washing instructions that that on the collar.

He works as a doctor so he wears dress shirts a lot of the time when he's seeing patients throughout the day. He's always worn an undershirt when he's working, and not working, but with those dress shirts, especially on warmer days in an office you tend to sweat and sweat tends to soak through your clothes and is then visible. He use to wear the regular cotton material undershirts but those would just end up getting wet and yucky by the end of the day, so I did some research for him and found these!!! They work amazing and he loves them. He says they're extremely lightweight and comfortable and unlike his other undershirts, when he sweats he doesn't feel the wetness of the sweaty shirt on his body all day. He doesn't even notice this undershirt is there! And the nicest part about the shirts is that they keep there nice pure white color! Even if you do mix your laundry load with colors and darks these will stay white and look nice under thinner/light color shirts! I ordered a large for him and that fit him perfectly. He was also a large in the regular undershirts!", "I've used Hanes shirts for a base layer under my dress clothing for some time, but had traditionally used the cotton shirts only.  After reading up on cotton and the comparison to polyester fabrics, I found that while cotton will soak up sweat, it does not dry quickly, and holds the moisture next to your body, causing all kinds of issues.Instead, these shirts are the \"dri fit\" type of fabric - soft to the touch, comfortable, and most importantly, they pull sweat away from the body and help it to rapidly evaporate.I have worn these shirts under dress clothes with positive results, but also tested them by wearing them as a base layer when out hiking and working up a sweat.  These shirts stayed comfortable, and I stayed pretty dry even though I was sweating.  I highly recommend these shirts, and have already bought more for myself.", "I ordered an adult small for my 5ft 100lb daughter to wear for a soccer try out.

Hanes hit a homer with these and I have now ordered three colors in packs of two. The very, very low prices for the packs of two cannot be beaten and you can even mix and match the colors but watch your pricing as some combinations ARE NOT Amazon Prime and have higher prices with freight charged. The care is as simple as throwing them into the cold wash with similar colors.

Buy them. No regrets!", "I work in a very hot environment and cotton shirts get soaked and stay wet in 5 minutes.  This shirt stays dry and it feels like I've got a tiny brezeze cooling me under the shirt all day as I work.  It doesn't stop you from staying wet and sweaty but it's much better than anything else I've tried.  Can't say about longevity but quality is good and I expect them to last.

I don't care for an over sized under-shirt", "I thought these felt plasticy when i first tried them out but stopped noticing it after 2 days of wearing these to work. Much better than cotton for keeping cool. The shirt will still get pretty moist if youre producing a lot of sweat but does not become an oven when it does.

Have a glossy shine to them vs cotton.Hanes has these for a better deal on their site, more colors, and you don't have to buy 2 packs for the better price. You just have to be willing to accept standard shipping vs prime. Ordered 11 to add to the 2 i already have.", "These are wonderful Tee shirts.

I wear these under my bulletproof vest at work every day during the summer and they do a far better job wicking the moisture away compared to cotton t-shirts.

I go to sites that sell shirts like this for $30-$50 just for this kind of quality. The softness from the polyester and cotton blend is what makes this shirt worth it. I just had to get rid of all my 100% cotton shirts because they felt too rough after I started wearing these. Not even my favorite brand store have this type of quality. I at least expected Hollister or Abercrombie to match this but even if they do They charge 3 times the price (on clearance too). I recommend this shirt brand too everyone. Just make sure to get 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The blend makes a huge difference. Not 50/50, Not 70/30, a true 60/40 is the one you want. Oh I almost forgot they even gave me a discount off my next purchase and I just started buying from them. Well Guess I'll starting buying from them now. See ya Later everyone.Edit 1. Where Do I even start. I was once so proud to be a customer for this seller but now I don't know what I'm getting. I just placed an order for the exact same shirt (size, color, and quantity). I was sure they would just send another shirt my way and I just pay for it like I regularly do on Amazon. I was glad to have been able to receive a quality shirt at first but now I just received something I can't even tell. They sent me not a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt but a Shaka Active shirt which is 100% cotton. The difference in the blend is very big too me. I like my 60/40 blend because of how soft the fabric is and how much more comfort I get wearing it. The brand Dream USA makes wonderful quality shirts and I admire their products. But for the Shaka Active shirt I receive was awful. Smells strange, and I don't even know why they sent me such a hippo-size shirt. I ordered a small. fabric was rough and poorly made; nothing compare to the 60% cotton / 40% polyester one I order 2 days ago. I just don't understand why they sent me this. Was it a mistake or a mix-up? Or perhaps they are trying to get rid of past inventory of Shaka Active shirts? All I want right now is just a replacement. I'll even take a different color (size: small [60% cotton / 40% polyester]).  I will buy again only if they truly do have a 60% cotton / 40% polyester shirt. I do not want to buy any more lies. Please I really want to buy more shirts. Here are some photos, The shirts may look alike but the texture is very different. First set is Shaka (100%) and Second set is A Real Dream USA shirt (60% cotton / 40% polyester) I'm repeating this a lot is because I do not want anymore 100% cotton shirts.Edit 2: Okay Okay You got me. So, as I was writing this review, it turns out they listen to me then sent me a replacement on the same day. I got my new shirt and it was a Dream USA shirt. I am confident now to start buying again. I just hope this does not happen again. I am also sorry to have said anything negative. You guys working in customer service, delivery, and manufacturing have done a wonderful job.

I ordered a medium and it fits amazingly, I have since bought 7 or 8 of them I like them that much. They are cut like a fitted shirt so the sleeves are a little tighter than a normal t-shirt and really makes for a great fit.

He wouldn't model for me. Lol its a large. Normally a xl.

They have some polyester woven in for moisture wicking. Though I prefer natural fibers on my body, I have to say these T-Shirts are comfortable, wear well, and DO wick away the moisture. The price is a bit steep though, so buy these when there is a sale or Carthartt rebate.I also tried a Dickies t shirt, they came 2 to a pack and were much cheaper in price. I like them as well.Almost forgot, I also chose these because I can get a light tan color which helps in the summer heat and doesn't look as bad if they get a little dirty.

Recently when he worked a storm, he stayed longer than we packed him to work  I told him I did not dry the shirts after I washed them and they dried looking great, So he washed them in the shower, and hung them to dry over the air conditioner. They dried perfectly for him to wear again. Love these and now I am purchasing long sleeved shirts, but remember these are the Carhartt Men's Force Cotton shirts 65% --35%. They look really nice good thing I got several different colors.", "These shirts are just 'okay'.  The material is a nice thickness and the cotton blend is very comfortable.  However, they are made in Guatemala and the sizing seems to be a little 'off'.  I realize they are relaxed fit - which in Carhartt'a nomenclature means 'tighter' than their original fit shirts.  The problem I have with the shirts is the length - both of the shirt and the sleeves.  The photos show the sleeves well above the elbow and in reality, they fall 2-3 inches lower than what the photo depicts.  The shirt length is also long - it's almost like a 'tall' size 3-4\" longer than most medium sized shirts I own.  The chest and shoulders fit about how a medium should.  I'm going to try a small.  I'm not sure if this is a qa/qc issue or if this style shirt is just a little odd.", "This is just a nice, comfortable shirt to wear. Cotton shirts have the ultimate feel, but I'm sick of them staying soaking wet forever and shrinking a ton when they dry. The blend in this one seems to keep the best of both worlds. Pocket is nice, not flimsy, and actually usable unlike many other t-shirts. Not a huge fan of the Carhartt logo on the pocket, but not an issue. I bought a 2XL and size seemed pretty true for me. Would definitely buy again and in other colors.", "Great shirts for the summer, will be ordering more soon.

Otherwise it's fine but I'd like to find a 100% cotton tee in 'XL tall'...", "Everybody knows that Carhartt makes some tough products, and these shirts are no exception. They don't fit exceptionally large, they are a bit long though. If you tuck in your shirt this is of course not a problem. The neck hole isn't very spacious, but it still fits me perfectly. I've worked outside for 8 hour days in the sun and these shirts have held up fine and have kept me cool. Yes, they're expensive shirts, but they're completely worth it in my experience. I have bought 5 of these shirts and they've all fit the same and been of the same quality. I have seen them go on sale a few times, so I would scoop them once they hit the &lt;$15 range, that is a very justifiable price for this product in my opinion.", "Great shirt heavy material &amp; I like the pen pocket inside the main one, be careful not to over cook it in the dryer it's 100% cotton &amp; will shrink but does stretch out after wearing it some I pull mine out of the dryer when it's still damp."]},

They do shrink up A LOT.  I ordered a second pack and compared one to a shirt I had been washing/wearing and there was a difference of several inches in length, at least an inch in sleeve, and probably a couple inches in chest.

Especially when you factor in the price.  It's tough to find a true big and tall undershirt - many brand I've tried are way to short, or the sleeves are too long, or the neck holes stretches way too much, etc.  But these are just a good, basic undershirt with no major problems in my opinion.  This is the second time I purchased these and the only issue I've noticed is that one shirt in the first package seemed to be slightly smaller than the others.  But after the second package I'm thinking this was not the norm.  I will purchase these again when I need more undershirts.", "I bought these shirts for my husband who has a really long torso and works in carpentry. He is always complaining about his under shirts coming un-tucked, and he gets a sun burn about 3\" above his pants, not to mention the \"plumber's crack\". I looked into getting him shirts from another company that advertises extra long tees, but found the price of $24.95 per shirt crazy for under shirts! I found these and figured even if they weren't long enough that they would be comparable to what he was already wearing, but they are perfect! Extra long without being too big everywhere else.

I said that these \"fit as expected\" because there is no \"fit entirely better than expected\" category. The manufacturer's claim of super-soft material and lack of coming untucked rang so true to me when I was reading the description for my re-order. They are so comfortable for both reasons. Again, I am replacing all my T shirts with these; my others are reasonable--hopefully someone will benefit via Goodwill--but these are just great as far as I am concerned.

Regular large size t shirts fit in length but are too baggy, and mediums fit in size but are not long enough. These fill both categories. Be careful washing on high heat though, some of mine have shrunk to the point that they are quite tight in my chest area, and just barely long enough to keep a button up shirt tucked in.

The cut of this V-Neck does not show when I leave the top button(s) unbuttoned on my dress and short sleeve button down shirts. This is a must for more casual use of my dress shirts.2. The length is long enough that this shirt tucks into my pants and does not come out when I raise my arms or reach down to tie my shoes. It's annoying when shirts come out of my pants and need adjusting. These are longer than normal and serve that purpose.3. These shirts are just the right thickness. They are not too thin that you can see through them and they are not too thick that they bunch or show that you are wearing an undershirt.4. Buffering layer: They are also just the right thickness and softness  to a) absorb sweat and b) buffer my skin from the outer shirt.5. Price: I'm very happy about the price for this six pack.

I currently have black, white, and grey. They are great quality at cheap price. They aren't super thick which i like since i'm wearing them under something else. Every one that i have received has been tagless. I saw some complaints of people getting ones with tags on them but none of the ones i order has had any tags.The one in the picture i have attached has been worn and washed at least 3 times.

Both seem to be of good construction and quality fabric.There is, however, one major difference:  The PGA TOUR shirts have accumulated a STINK over the past few months. The 100% polyester PGA shirts now have \"an odor\" whereas the 90% cotton/10% polyester Hanes shirts do not.How am I doing laundry?  I throw them into the washing machine and then into the dryer.  Yes, I know, I've checked the internet and found out that I can de-stinkify polyester shirts through a simple process of soaking them for a few hours in a mixture of hot water, vinegar, and Listerine mouthwash.  It really does work...temporarily.  Thing is, I just want to do my laundry and not make an all-day affair out of it.CONCLUSION:  My experiment was a success.

It does look like the picture they show.Very good quality for the money.The product came on time.", "This has become my new work shirt. We have to wear either black or white at work and with me being a bigger guy.....solid white just doesn't look great on me. The shirt breathes well in the summer. I live in SW Arizona and it consistently hits 108+ degrees in the summertime. So having a shirt that can breathe helps out a ton. I still sweat in it, but I can cool off quickly once indoors.The one thing I have noticed is that over time the shirt has become a duller black. Yes the shirt is black, but it's more of a dark black not pure black as when I first bought it. My only guess to that is because the dye is fading over the every other day washes.", "These polos are fantastic. They are soft, breathable, and wash and dry wonderfully. We have purchased two white and one black in the XXXL size and they have been washed an worn many times. Fit is consistent between colors and these are nice and long.

We will be getting more of these in the future.", "First reaction: soft!Second reaction: kinda big!After reading the reviews complaining about it being \"too small\", I thought I'd play it safe and order a size up. I'm 5'11\", 180 lb (180 cm and 80 kg for everyone else in the world) and I'm on the thicker side-- I go to the gym 5 days a week, but I also eat ice cream 7 days a week, so I'm sure it adds up.I tried it on as soon as I got it and it's definitely on the larger side/fits like a \"regular large\" would fit on me. I own mostly medium shirts, so I know what a large feels like. It does feel on the longer side, but I expect it to shrink some since most of the reviews say that as well. I'm using this polo shirt as a Halloween costume, so I won't go through the simple (but still kind of arduous) process of returning and purchasing a better-fitting size.In my honest opinion, I don't think it makes me look fat, although a bit baggy at the armpit areas. I do adjust the bottom when reaching into my pockets, but that doesn't bother me very much. Since the shirt is so darn soft, I'll probably use it to sleep/lounge when I want to relax but also have a collar-- which, by the way, is definitely on the larger side for those of you that like a snug collar. Thankfully, the relaxed fit of the shirt sags the collar and doesn't make me look too much like a turtle.The material breathes okay, but nothing like Nike or other dedicated athletic wear. It'll probably get a little hot in the sun, but it won't be like wearing a trash bag. Overall, it seems like a solid shirt!

Both are bright, vibrant colors that pop.Sizing: I have (in actual tape measured inches) a 42 inch chest, 36 inch waist, and 14 inch unflexed  biceps.

On every single shirt I've had to tie off and cut the stitching under the arms.  I'm not sure if this is just excess stitching that comes loose after a few uses and washes, or what.  No holes have opened up, so I'm hoping that's the case.  It's just a bit worrisome when you've worn the shirt 5 times and have to cut foot long strings out of the armpit.But... they're cheap to replace and look good enough that it's not a big thing.  I'll probably buy some more when these get ragged.  On the good side they fit well and the fabric doesn't pill like some other shirts I've had.", "As I expected, this shirt went beyond my expectations. It has been worn and washed multiple times and it has retained its shape and color.  Often with other clothing with a red color, the color fades or bleeds. Not so with this shirt.  I have enjoyed wearing it and I receive compliments on it.  The fabric is soft which makes it comfortable to wear often.  It is casual and yet, it is dressy for going out. The sleeve length and the length of the shirt are perfect. The collar has a slight stiffness to enable it to retain its shape although it is extremely comfortable. The buttons are attached well and fit well in the button holes.Hanes has a reputation of manufacturing great products and it is evident in this product and others I have used. I highly recommend this shirt and this manufacturer.  I will definitely buy this brand again and I look forward to purchasing the variety of colors it comes in.

I used to be an athlete, but now I have a paunch and am carrying extra weight all over, probably about 30 pounds more than I should for my height. But this shirt fits perfectly; not too loose and not too tight.If you're a really thin guy for your shoulder width, I think you might want a different cut or size.If you have particularly long arms, or wide shoulders, and/or a pronounced midsection, you might need to go a size up. However, if you are average to just a bit heavier than average, you should fit just fine in the size you normally wear.", "I\u2019ve had this shirt for a whole now and it\u2019s become one of my favorite shirts. It\u2019s been thru the wash plenty of times and it has held up very well.", "I really like this shirt.  It's well made of nice material, feels good, looks great, and the price is fabulous.

I tried them on when the first arrived and the length was good. After a single wash (cold) and dry (warm) they have lost at least 2\" in length, making them near impossible to tuck in and remain tucked in. So for anyone wondering... Yes, these shrink quite a lot in the length.  Interestingly they did not really shrink at all around the chest/waist dimension.A couple other issues I had with these, that I have not had with other brands is that the seam along the bottom of the shirt and around the ends of the arms was not flat. If these were not meant as undershirts I envision I would be going through and having to do some serious ironing to ensure all the seams were down nicely.Lastly, the elastic around the neck seems to be of lower quality material and is not as taunt as I guess I would prefer.

We submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a 20% restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying.

I am pretty much a perfect size medium (5'8\" and 160 pounds, with an athletic build) but in some cases I get stuck buying a large because the medium is too tight across my chest and shoulders. In those cases the large is always too long in the body and arms which makes it look and feel sloppy. This Jerzees shirt is proportioned just right for me in my actual size.

The fabric feels great, and the bright red really does pop. The sleeves are a good length for me, something which is not always the case with shirts since i have long arms. I purchased a size larger than normal half-expecting the shirt to run small, but this was not the case. It fits exactly as I'd hoped a shirt of the size up would, which is great for me really since I prefer baggier clothes to tighter.

The seam came open and on one of the unraveled so that the whole cuff came off. I put a few stitches on the seam near the cuff on the others and they've been fine.", "The shirt was delivered promptly with no defects. Personally I am looking for a work shirt. This shirt seams light weight and a bit on the stretchy side. Cotton blend might be a little excessive for my purposes.

I have had some previous experience with the \"beefy t's\" in years past.  They didn't shrink much, and were durable.  These T-Shirts feel a little less substantial than the ones in memory, and a large t-shirt should not feel like a medium after washing it.Given that the price is good, and the quality OK, as long as you keep in mind that they run a bit small, these shirts may work for you.

After the first wash, they shrank considerably, reducing them down to what other tees would be a 'large.'  On the plus side, they seem to wear well, and with subsequent washings, I'm hoping they will fit just a bit more loosely.  I've really liked the other Beefy-Tees I've had.

All in all, this is a nice long sleeve shirt if you can match a size to your body.  The XL fit is close for me but probably better suited more as an undershirt for layering purposes but a bit too tight for wearing on it's own on my size frame.

I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked as well.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer. Also, I think that the Gilden shrank significantly in the first wash. The shrinkage seemed to be in t in the shoulders and in the length. I would say that the T-shirt went from a large to a medium. It still fits but I had wanted a large T-shirt, not a medium.  I washed the T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.", "My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.

I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.

I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.

I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own.

I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up.

Most I come across may be great in width but come extremely short in the length, or great in length but a bit narrower in the fit. These hit the perfect proportions for me. The fit and length are perfect. The cotton is also extremely high quality feeling compared to shirts around the same price point. I\u2019d go so far to say they feel like the premium line of Polo Ralph Lauren T\u2019s (but better fitting). The sleeves are perfect length and having put them through a few laundry cycles, the collar hasn\u2019t stretched out or started to curl.They\u2019re just really damn good shirts, and at $15 a pop, you can grab a few of them without breaking the bank."]},

I wanted something a bit more upscale than whatever Chinese mass manufacturer I had bought my previous shirt from, but I had a hard time justifying spending $20 for a shirt that is not much more complicated two pieces of cloth sewn together. This item from Goodthreads seemed to hit a sweet spot.PROS- Good material- Adequately assembled- The neckline does not swoop downThe tag says that the shirt is 100% cotton, but it is surprisingly stretchy. I do not recall my other shirts being quite so pliable, but I am not complaining. The fibers are smooth and the fabric breaths well, which is perfect for looking good even in blazing Hawaii weather. After the first wash, there were a couple loose strings, but the seams look to be of reasonable quality and I do not except them to unravel or for more strings to come apart.However, what I most appreciate about the shirt is that the neckline does not plunge downwards, which seems to be an increasingly popular style these days. I want to see my collar bones, not my chest hair. If you are looking for something more revealing, this is not your shirt.CONS- NoneI have nothing bad to say about this shirt yet.CONSIDERATIONS- Seems to run on the small side- Uncertain longevityThe one thing that you should note is that this shirt runs rather small. I ordered a medium, but it feels close to a small. I prefer a looser fit, so I think I might order a size up next time.

It happened to one, so I thought it was random/a lemon. Then it happened to a second and third tee!For the price point (which is the same at American Eagle), these tees should be able to go 6 months to a year without seams failing. Unacceptable and I really feel like I wasted my money.

I got XL to be sure they would still be comfortable if they shrink.  I have washed a few times and they don't seem to shrink as much as some reviewers experienced. Probably could have gone with a Large as the fit is boxy.

I wanted white cotton t-shirt material for it's breathability, and low price so that if a shirt got trashed in the process it wasn't a big deal or I could die it if I really needed to.Not much else to it, these are long sleeve white t shirts, so if you like wearing white t shirts, just imagine the sleeves being extended and there you have it! White is also good for summer yard work since it reflects the sun light. They also do okay and blocking the thorns and branches although it isn't the most durable material. I feel certain I will get more than my moneys worth from these as I tend to keep my white t shirts for many years until they practically disintegrate.", "Though I wish that they were additionally offered as a combination of colors in one package I am very happy with this purchase. This is very durable material and much thicker than a standard t-shirt. I normally don't wear a snug t-shirt but I like the feel of this cotton. I absolutely recommend that you get a size larger if you don't like a tapered feel because they do shrink a bit when you wash them and naturally I suggest you doing that first BEFORE you wear them.", "The neck is insanely squiggly. They are also VERY short shirts. I am just 5 feet 6 inches tall and the medium shirts were way too short, lifting my hands a tiny bit reveals my belly button. These shirts SUCK.

One day, when my brain was working, I decided to peruse through Amazon. I couldn't believe my luck, when I found the Hanes Beefy tees. So I ordered 12. But you have to know: The ones I purchased at Wal-Mart 10 years ago, are still holding up, (barely). If you are married to a larger size man, or if YOU happen to be one, these are THE best quality t-shirts you'll ever find, or wear. They stand up to hundreds of washings, and the color seletion is superb. But the most important thing to us, is that they are 100% cotten. Best quality for your money.", "I ordered a medium, which according to Haynes is for chests 38-40. My chest is exactly 40. When I tried the shirt on it was skin tight; so tight that I actually had some problems peeling it off. I then measured the shirt front just below the armpits and it was 19\" wide; times two is 38\". This explains why it was so tight for a 40 chest. As far as \"beefy\" was concerned, my opinion is that it's not. It's not thin, but neither is it heavy. Hanes used to sell a true \"beefy\" T, which I wore for probably 10 years, but a few years ago they cheapened the product.I had also been considering buying similar shirts from LL Bean or Land's End, but those cost 3 times as much; around $18 each, I decided to return the Hanes shirts and see what the much higher price of a LL Bean shirt would get me. When the shirts arrived I did some comparisons. The LL Bean shirt chest front measured 22\" (compared to 19\" for the Hanes) and it weighed 7.6  oz compared to 6.5 oz for the Haines; i.e. the LL Bean shirt was beefier than the Hanes, even though it was described as standard weight.Is it worth 3 times the price? Probably not. Just order one size up, don't expect a heavy weight shirt, and you'll probably be happy and definitely richer.", "This shirt is very well made with a thick weave.  The color matches the picture even after repeated washings and there is no noticeable shrinkage even after tumble-drying on my dryer's highest setting.  I also tried applying iron-on transfers made for dark t-shirts to one of them and it worked beautifully.  I would recommend washing the shirt first, however, before trying to apply any iron-on transfer.", "I don\u2019t know why I just don\u2019t understand that you get what you pay for.I bought two of these, one Royal Blue and one Black.After washing and drying on a low setting, the overall shrinkage was minimal but as I suspected might happen, the bottom of the shirt folds up below the bottom seam. It is almost impossible to get it to fold back. Spraying a mist of water and adding a few clothes pins helps but that\u2019s just ridiculous.In addition to that, the seams where the sleeves are sewn to the body of the shirt are all puckered. It\u2019s impossible to flatten them, even ironing them.They are just plain old garbage and I should have paid double for one shirt...at least I would have had a wearable shirt instead of none.", "Junk!  These used to be like G.I. issue shirts long ago.  Now they include stretched out neck bands which get larger when washed!  I'm sorry I bought them, typical Asia made shirts with poor quality.

These are great work shirts and just general usage shirts and the only decent t-shirt with a pocket anymore.* Durability for cheap.  For $7 a shirt you get a fairly beefy cotton that doesn't rip the instant it catches on anything.  It holds up well in the wash.  The dye doesn't seem to fade.  I can't tell the difference between two year old and two month old shirts.* Pocket is nice.  It's big enough to stuff your phone into it, but its better suited to light items that won't fall out due to gravity if you bend forward and stuff that you can clip to the edge of the pocket.  Business cards, paper notes, pens, and small flashlights with pocket clips all do well in the pocket.  If you put a phone in it expect it to flop out on the concrete if you bend forward more than 45 degrees.* Consistency.  I've bought 8 of these so far, two at a time over the course of about two years as I replaced my other work t-shirts.  The sizing has not been altered in that time, nor has the material weight.  I can't even tell the difference between the shirts from two years ago and the most recent ones, they don't even seem to have worn.* Modest cut.  They lean toward the boxy side which is fine if you aren't trying to show off.  If you're a little on the pudgy side it's actually preferable.  When I first got these I was about 195 at 6'1\", two years later I've slimmed down while hitting the weights and sitting at 175 with a little more muscle in my upper torso and considerably less fat around my waist.  If you want to turn any heads or catch any eyes this is not your go to t-shirt.", "After one washing in lukewarm water, the shirt which was extra-large became more like a large and was very tight on my shoulders and chest, I do not have a gut. My recommendation would be to tell prospective buyers that because you are selling a 100% pure cotton material which is not interwoven with any synthetic fabric, that some shrinkage should be anticipated, and suggest that they take a next size up. Just a suggestion ,I was in the dry cleaning and laundry business for 40 years. The quality and workmanship of the shirt in my opinion is excellent!

The polo has a sporty fit; I am 6'1\" and 235lbs and the XL fits just right.Negatives:Material is almost too stretchy, which makes it difficult to tuck in and get the right amount pulled out.

I'm cheap. And I'm resourceful. I took in an inch on the sides of these suckers and they're as good as new(ish).*****************My husband fell in love with this brand after he wore one from a local gym. He took note of the brand and then started searching the internet for it. Luckily he found it on Amazon. He knew to go up a size so it would fit better. He bought one, and then two more. And then three more. They are really soft and are a good fit (remember to go up a size).Another thing he really likes about it is that they are long enough (but not crazy long) to cover his concealed carry when he carries on his belt. He also likes the sleeve length, because as he proudly puts it, \"they show off my biceps\"This is a little embarrassing, but I started liking his shirts... so I made him buy me one. And now I think I have four. No, I have five. They are just really comfortable. It's not like I'm dressing up for my toddlers, so I wear them all the time. And to Wal-Mart. Because they're actually one of the nicest plain t-shirts I've ever worn. Comfortable enough to wear to bed as well. And, yeah, I'll just say it, not all t-shirts are great for breastfeeding with, but these are great.

I have read hundreds of reviews where no one bothers putting their measurements, which I find absolutely useless for anyone else, so hopefully my review helps some of you. I was skeptical at first, just like every other time I've purchased a cheap t-shirt online (too short, too slim, too blocky, too wide, uncomfortable material), but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this shirt on.I am 6'4\", 215-225 lbs and fit, so length and slimness is important to me. I bought an XL, and the length is incredible (if maybe not slightly long for some, but probably perfect after a wash). Not too often you get an XL with a cheap shirt and they keep it slim fitting rather than extending the width 15 inches assuming you're only going up a size because you're 300lbs. It fits the shoulders great. The XL extends to the ends of my shoulders ALMOST perfectly (sorry, don't have exact measurements to help here). As for the sleeves, another bonus! We all have hatred for flared sleeves and they feel like they're inevitable in cheap t-shirts. I have around 15\" cold biceps for reference and they hug the biceps all the way through without being too tight. They extend not too far past the halfway point in the bicep which I prefer (picture is accurate). Lastly, the material is very comfortable. The pictures were a bit deceiving when I was trying to guess how the material would feel but I can say my expectations were surpassed.Hopefully this helps out fellow brothers my size.

Lots of brands have met me down, being too small on me in small but too big on me in medium, but due to Reddit reviews, I decided to give a medium Next Level a try.I read through hundreds and hundreds of reviews, but one thing not a single one has mentioned are the actual measurements of their shirts.I ordered the black CVC. New and unwashed, laying flat on a flat surface after wearing for a couple hours, the medium measures around 6.75 inches in the bicep opening, 20.5 inches pit to pit, has a sleeve length of 9 inches and a length of 29 in the front and 29.3 in the back. So honestly, slimmer than most brands, but not as slim as I had hoped and too baggy every which way.However, after washing for 45 mins on warm, and drying for roughly 40 mins on warm (so the middle setting), the shirt ended up measuring 6.25 inches in the bicep, 19.5 pit to pit, has a sleeve length of 8.4 inches and a length of 28.5 front and back.Ultimately, this is just about perfect for me, and I have ordered several more.

It almost seems like a set of 3x or 4x shirts got the wrong tags. Having said that, I ordered this model shirt two each in three different colors, and the fit for all 6 was identical, so apparently it's just how they're made.

I don't want to make false claims but it doesn't seem like a regular dickies work shirt. Other ones I have purchased show sizing using a letter indicating whether it's small, large or so on. This particular tag uses a numerical size rating. This shirt also came with a missing button hole for the bottom button. On these shirts, there should be a dickies tag on the bottom of the shirt near the last button and this shirt did not have that. I also lined up this shirt alongside the other dickies work shirt to notice any other differences regarding construction. This shirt doesn't seem to line up the same with the stitchings as if the pattern for the material cutouts they used for the individual pattern pieces are different for this particular shirt. I can also notice that the stitching and spacing for the pen hole in the pocket are different than the other ones I have. Overall I am disappointed in this purchase and will probably order directly from dickies next time."]},

It fell to my hips (i'm 5'3 135bls) and wasn't baggy or tight. I couldn't leave it on for more than 2 mins without being completely agitated. The sleeves fell at a really weird place on my arms. It's a v neck and in my (probably a bit conservative) opinion, is cut a little too deep. The print was really the problem. It was too low on the shirt. It sort of sat toward the mid stomach area.

When I was picking this out I wasn't sure what shade of yellow to expect. It seemed like it could be a bright sun yellow but was more of a golden yellow. I actually love the golden yellow look. It is bright but not to bright. It allows the text on the shirt to be read easier. May pick up a few more with different quotes."]},

You have to expect to order a pair of your size and see what you get, they could be too small or big from what the reviews are saying.  Mine were too small, not only in length, but the top of the shoe was really tight.  I read where some people said to remove the memory foam from inside and they would fit better.

The size I ordered this time, is a little small, but that's my fault. I can wear an 8 or an 8 1/2, I just usually go by how they feel when I try them on. I wasn't sure with the Tom's, since I hadn't even tried them on before, so I ended up going with an 8. They actually fit fine and they're already stretching a bit from wearing them, but I think I will definitely go with the 8 1/2 next time.The shoe is great! I'm happy with my purchase.

However, this was my second pair and I wasn't so much impressed. The very first day I wore them the inside sole completely detached and came out.

I do wear small Dr. Scholl's insoles to give a little bit of arch support. The bottoms are a bit slippery, but in general I plan on buying at least one more pair of these - I have the ash and navy colors and want to add red!

The price worked out to about $6 per shirt, which is AMAZING. (I purchased three 3-packs at $18 each.) The material of the shirts is somewhat thin, so I definitely don't recommend wearing the white shirt on its own. You could get away with wearing the darker colors on their own though.

I love the quality of the clothes, color selection, and how they are designed to keep you cool (or warm, depending on the line). I decided to get some more workout shirts this year and wanted to try some with a pattern rather than just the solid shirts, since I have some of those already. I didn't have any of the Twist Tech shirts and decided to give them a try.This Under Armour Twist Tech shirt is part of Under Armour's HeatGear line, which is designed to keep you cool in warm weather. This shirt is considered a LOOSE fit, which means you will most likely want to purchase a smaller size for a more comfortable fit. The shirt has a flattering V-neck cut and has a twisted, or heathered, pattern that makes it different than a solid color shirt. These shirts are made in Jordan of 100% polyester. Washing instructions say to wash with similar colors. I always put these in the washing machine on a normal cycle, hang them up to dry, and I've never had a problem with shrinking.I initially purchased one of these shirts to make sure I had the right size and loved it so much I ordered two more! For size reference, I am 5'6\", 165 pounds, with a 36D chest and some extra belly fat from my twin pregnancy and I purchased a medium. I typically wear a medium or large in shirts and, since this shirt is a loose fit, I went with the medium and it fits perfectly! These shirts are so comfortable and I wear them a lot for working out. They keep me as cool and dry as possible (of course, I still sweat). They wash up well and I am also able to wear them for everyday wear with yoga pants. My mom is in her early 60s and wears these shirts for everyday wear, along with under her scrubs for work. She loves them as much as I do and wants to get some more! The fit is nice and comes down to the top of my rear, which is just how I like. I purchased the colors Pink Shock/Metallic Silver, Mediterranean/Metallic Silver, and Absinthe Green/Metallic Silver and I'm considering purchasing a couple more.I love these shirts and feel they are great for working out or for everyday wear. Please note, this shirt is a LOOSE fit so you will want to purchase a smaller size for a more flattering fit. I'd say if you have two sizes of shirts you normally wear, purchase the smaller size for this shirt. The shirt is nice enough to wear in public and I also purchased\u00a0Under Armour Women's Armour Mid Sports Bra, Pink Shock/Rhino Gray, Large\u00a0so I could color-coordinate with my shirts. I love these shirts and highly recommend them!", "I'm 5'5\" (168cm), 27.5' waist and ordered S. I was expecting semi-fitted but it happened to be a loose fit.As a loose fit, I chose the right size because it looks exactly like the model in the picture. Never snug around my waist.S is good for running but XS would have been better for weight training.(Size S width: chest 47cm, hem 51cm/ sleeve : 16cm/ length : 67cm)I learned that I should check the fit on the UA website before I buy.", "I have four of these shirts and absolutely love them! They work great for all-day wear and hold up very well during my sweaty weightlifting sessions (1.5-2 hours long). My favorite feature of these shirts would have to be their ability to make you appear less sweaty than you actually are. As someone who does power lifting, Olympic lifting, and cardio in a non-air conditioned warehouse in the South, having a t-shirt that doesn't appear soaked in sweat, and doesn't showcase big armpit sweat stains (those are the worst), ten minutes into your workout, is a miracle. It also helps that these shirts are breathable and quick to dry. After each workout, I hand-wash the shirt with a little bit of soap, gently squeeze out the water from the shirt, put it on a hanger, and hang it from my shower head to dry - that way, I don't have to buy a week's worth of shirts or do the laundry every other day.Aside from functionality, the t-shirt, for me, fits as expected and per the size chart. I tend to prefer looser-fitting shirts and size medium, for my 34C-bra size, long torso - I'm 6 ft, and swimmer's shoulders (much broader than average), fits perfectly. I don't find these shirts to be transparent at all - I can wear a bright, different-colored sports bra underneath and it doesn't show through.

The fit is perfect and form fitting, not lose and not tight and that's how I wanted it. I just hope it doesn't shrink much. I'm normally an XL or XXL on Amazon. I read reviews so I knew it should fit me because it's a lose fit shirt so order a size down if you want it to be a form fit. My only complaint is that it shows my tummy bulge more then I would like.

This shirt is fantastic - gorgeous colors, great cut, nice fabric, well made.  I own an ivory similar one by a name brand that cost about $100, and this one is nicer.  The only downside is I thought it would be easy to dye a white shirt a different color (as if there weren't enough choices), something I do often with modal fabric.  I failed to take into account the white thread, which does not dye at all, so the colored shirt has white stitching.  Bummer.  But with so many colors to choose from, that is a minor problem.  Highly recommend!", "Very good quality tshirt. It's soft, a good length, and fits very well. I am 5'5, 158 lbs, bra size 38C and ordered a Large. It fits perfectly.

I ordered 3, since there was a great color selection.The quality of the fabric is nice, the colors are lovely. The length is great, and even the sleeves aren't too short. The problem is the sizing. These run extremely small. While I can fit into them, they are skin tight, showing off every bit of my tummy. They look terrible over pants or jeans. I can't imagine these fitting someone at the higher range of the sizing chart. Perhaps if every fiber was stretched to the breaking point. . .I will keep them to wear tucked into a skirt, but that will be all I can do with them. Don't trust the size chart.

It is more of a form-fitting shirt than a flowy shirt. Not really what I was expecting. This shirt will show all of your flaws, which I am very self-conscious about.", "This Aolakeke Cold Shoulder Blouse fit awesome. The material is very soft. Perfect to dress up or dress down. The cold shoulder and the criss cross neck detailing add a bit of fun and flirtiness.The material is so soft, breathable and lightweight it makes it perfect for travel. Great for packing in a suitcase or a duffle.The color was just as shown in picture. It also has nice stretch so even if you are a little bigger than the size you can fit it. It flows beautiful as well. I love the scallop detailing for the hem.Loving this top.", "This shirt is advertised as primarily cotton - but it is not.  I'd be surprised if there's any cotton AT ALL in this product.  Very disappointed.  The label inside the garment says it's 95% cotton and 5% polyester but it is NOT.  I know the difference - NOT COTTON.  Which is why I wanted this shirt.  Cute design &amp; color but I prefer all (or mostly) natural fibers.", "I bought a large and that fell off me. Tried the medium, I wore it one day and the sleeves are very, kind of slippery. The shirt doesn\u2019t stay put on your shoulders and the criss cross straps just fall  they don\u2019t stay put either. I really like the shirt tho. Maybe I should have tried a small but I\u2019m usually a medium or large.  It probably be better if you wear it alone, no sweater or jacket. Then it may stay put on you correctly. The model looks terrific but doesn\u2019t look like that when you wear it.", "Beautiful top! The fabric is very soft and hangs nicely~not too clingy. The army green color is vibrant but is not really army green. It looks like the picture, more of a hunter green.  I'm a 38DD and have a hard time finding tops that aren't tight at the top and this is perfect! I ordered XL.", "Beautiful blue color and design. However, upon opening the package and trying it on, I noticed the right sleeve is stretched out of shape and the opening on the right shoulder of this shirt is bigger than the opening on the other sleeve, making the shirt look a little less refined. I don't like the way that looks. Thinking about sending it back to get another of the same shirt, hoping this won't be the case again. Ugh :(", "Incredibly comfortable shirt! Color is actually quite close to the picture. My recommendation is to not dry this in the dryer - let this one dry flat. The material is very soft, this has become one of my favorite shirts.", "This top fits well and is a nice soft material. My only complaint is the color. It is much lighter / pastel than pictured. I love the medium vibrant purple as pictured. What I received is a light / soft lilac color. It still like it, and will keep it, but would have preferred that it was colored as pictured."]},

Don't expect these to be walking around the market  (flea or grocery) shoes.. i wear my strictly on \"holidays\".. July 4th cookout, Memorial Day picnic, Labor Day gathering, etc... Read about \"Tom's\" online &amp; see why you should buy from them.. They donate shoes to people in poor countries. I get lots of compliments on these shoes!", "Definitely not like my other toms. While I love the design. They fit way smaller than my others in the same size.  Still hoping they will strech some.  The insole is much thicker and is removable,  not sure if this is a new design or like others have said a fake. I Judy wish they wound have fit like all my other ones.  Definitely a disappoint", "So comfortable!  True to size. Picture is showing the already a little beat up but I literally wear them to run errands, work he yard, you name it.", "I am somewhat of a shoe \"snob\" and definitely prefer TOMS brand shoes. Their brand is consistently comfortable and fits as expected (only because I know how to order them)... This being said, please note that TOMS shoes *usually* stretch a bit after a few wears. After purchasing my first pair a few years ago (the same size I wear with all other shoes), I learned this the hard way. I now order my TOMS a half-size (or full-size, if half is not available) smaller than my typical shoe size. After the first day, they stretch to the \"right\" size and fit comfortably from then on. I've received many compliments from these shoes too and would recommend these gems to anyone! :)", "I\u2019ve had these for a couple months now and the foam is already breaking down and separating from the shoe. The canvas the shoe is made of is great and stands up to daily wear. If only the sole would hold of adequately. These are definitely not well enough made for daily use.", "Material will cause blisters. I thought I could break these in, but the fabric is way too unforgiving.", "I got the black and white tile print Toms as well as a pair in dark pink. They're both real Toms and fit just like all my other pairs do. What I didn't realize was that the black and white pair is vegan so they have this squishy sort of insert in them rather than the leather that is usually there, which is fine by me but the issue is that the vegan insole comes out when I take the shoes off so that's pretty annoying but after looking on the Toms website I learned that it's supposed to be removable. It's a small annoyance of an otherwise great pair of shoes. The pink ones looks more on the red side but I knew that when I got them", "Love my Toms! They do run a little small (I had to go up a size than what I usually wear), but I think it\u2019s just because of the material and shape. The toe box is a little tight at first, but stretches out with use and gets more comfortable. They are my go to shoes when going out and about; I love that they are fast and easy to slip on and I don\u2019t have to tie anything. Recommended!", "I have funky, small feet (6.5) and my right foot is slightly wider than my left. It was a pretty rock solid shoe at first but wear it around the house for a day and they\u2019re pretty comfy! I\u2019m a fan, but be leary cause I know Toms does not work for everyone. Be careful with the pinky toes wide-feet peeps!", "I have been buying the same exact shoes for a few years, and decided to buy this pair of TOMS Del Rey shoes from this seller this time. I normally buy them from Journeys shoe store. Long story short, these shoes are tagged incorrectly with \u201cmade in Vietnam\u201d. TOMS are made in a number of different countries but Vietnam is not one of them. The blue patch on the back of the shoes were also crooked. Real TOMS are centered with clean stitching. I know that the pair I got were counterfeit TOMS and they were very uncomfortable and tore up the heel of my foot. I returned these shoes to this amazon seller and purchased a REAL pair on the Journeys website. I am very disappointed."]},
{"asin": "B07BKV4RK5", "comments": ["OK, folks, I don't often leave product reviews, but the moment these amazing sandals/flip-flops were placed upon my feet, I swear I could hear my little tootsies SING!  I have plantar fasciitis, and so I need supportive, cushy footwear. My feet are also a bit on the chubby side, so I can't wear \"normal\" sandals because they are always too tight...which means I normally just have to settle for flip flops, which are not always the perfect match for the outfit and situation that I am in.These sandals are perfect! They look dressy enough to wear with a nice summery dress out to dinner, and yet not so stuffy that I couldn't throw on a pair of short and a t-shirt and head out to the park.  They are a DREAM to walk in!!! The \"strap\" material is stretchy enough to accommodate moving around and walking, and yet supportive enough to feel like these shoes won't fall off. They do give a very slight tug back into place, if that makes sense. The cushion is perfectly squishy without being too squishy - just enough squish for my plantar fasciitis to be happy walking in these all day. No, seriously...ALL DAY.I am currently wondering what is the appropriate amount of time to wait before I tell my husband that I'm buying several more pair in other colors? Psssshaw, I'm going to just go ahead and do it!! You should, too!I normally wear a 9 1/2 to a 10, depending on the brand of shoe. I got these in a 10 and they fit me perfectly with a little room past my toes and behind my heel, but that's how I like it. Sometimes when I'm sitting or walking in just the right way, my feet always tend to shift in whatever shoes I am wearing, so I like a little room to move around.p.s. I hate it when people leave reviews saying they got their stuff for free or discounted (and, gosh, why aren't companies offering ME free stuff or discounts, eh?!)...so I'm happy to report that I am a REAL person who paid full price for these. Worth every penny!", "I've been trying to avoid dropping $30 on a pair of flip flops but after searching tirelessly for something both cheap and comfortable with no luck, I finally broke down and got some yoga slings.  Ordered the same pattern in 2 different colors and absolutely love them!  I would prefer a little more arch support but overall they are very comfortable and super cute.I pretty consistently wear an 8.5 and after reading all of the reviews, I decided to order up and get a 9.  They seemed a bit big but I was leaving for the beach in just a few days, so I quickly ordered them in 8 and planned to return whichever didn't fit.  I snapped this photo of an 8 (back/left) and a 9 (front/right) in the hopes that it might help the other in-betweeners.  Maybe it's just because I have short toes but there was just too much extra space at the front for my liking.  The 8's fit great and the 9's were returned!", "First off, if you're reading reviews of this product because you're considering purchasing a pair -- I can easily say just do it. These are great, comfy and adorable shoes.But I'm going to go against popular opinion here regarding going up or down for half-size people. I'm an 8.5 in everything -- boots, flats, pumps, trainers. Against my better judgement -- I followed the advice of other reviewers and went with a size down.When the shoes arrived I knew instantly that I loved them. However -- I had mixed feelings about the size. They fit -- but they *just* fit. When it comes to flip-flops I like a bit of overhand at the heel. Call it an OCD or whatever, but i like the shoe to extend ever-so-slightly from my heel.So I wrestled with what to do -- conquer my obsessive attitude and DEAL WITH IT or get a size 9.Not only did I buy a size 9 -- I bought two pairs in size 9.  AND they are PERFECT.I'm not returning the original size 8, either. I'm going to gift them to my sister who wears a 7.5 -- I just know she'll love these too.", "I racked up a whopping 68 miles across six park days in Disney World wearing only these flip flops. My steps are often missed while I'm pushing the stroller so I'm sure there were even more miles than that. I always wear broken-in tennis shoes on big walking days and packed them with me just in case these flip flops didn't work out, but I never needed them! My feet normally get very hot and swell and I really hate wearing tennis shoes. I never wore these before our trip and was so happy there was no break in period at all. It even rained for hours on end one day and my feet were still comfortable in these. I just dried them with the hotel hairdryer that evening and wore them again the next day. The only time they were even the slightest bit uncomfortable was when my preschooler accidentally spilled orange juice on my feet and the piece between my toes got a tad sticky and rubbed. Fortunately it never caused a blister and once the fabric dried out, it was comfortable again. I would highly, highly, highly recommend these! These are going to be my forever disney, zoo day, travel, etc. shoes!! As for fit, I felt like these were a bit big. I usually wear a 7.5. I have pretty wide feet, so sometimes I need an 8 just because I need the width. I ordered an 8 in these since a half size wasn't available. The 8 felt fine enough to keep but if i order another pair, I believe I will go down to a 7.", "I have 4 pair of Sanuk Yoga Slings. I love them that much!! I normally wear a 7 1/2 shoe and I took the advice to order a size 8 since they don't come in half sizes. Good advice!! They fit perfectly!", "I love, love, love these! I was worried about how they'd look on my feet, I have chubby feet, but they feet like a glove. They are great. And oohh so comfortable! I originally bought them as beach shoes but, I'm not gonna lie, I'm gonna wear them all the time!", "Wow! The design itself is beautiful! I'm very happy with this purchase. Very comfortable. I will buy more! \u2764\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\u2764", "Not an orthotic sandal, but sooo comfortable anyway, just don't look for arch support! Stay on don't slide or slip! I often buy a 9-1/ 2 in sandals and a 10 in shoes. I tried 9 and 10 and 10 are the better fit, not too long. If i n doubt i would go up the size. I saw these on Amazon just browsing and loved them. I bought for a cruise because nothing is worse than sore feet or a sandal that rubs into a blister. These will pack flat for suitcase room since I carry on to an airplane and will be good wherever so multi use is good! I love them and sooo cute. Just a great buy!.", "I generally wear a 9.5. When a brand doesn't carry half sizes, I usually go up a size, but my last pair of Sanuks was a bit loose as a 10, so I went down to a 9 for these. The 9 is perfect me. I have really high arches, so I was a little worried that the strap over the top of the foot would be too tight, but they fit just fine - to give myself a bit more space I switched the layering of the straps from the way they are in the picture, so that the over-foot strap is underneath the ankle strap. The soles are super-comfy, and I don't think the toe piece will require the usual wearing-in period since the fabric is so soft. Another plus - the shoes came in a really neat sustainable draw-string bag.Update 3/21/14: I bought these days before a 2 week beach resort vacation. These shoes were amazing - I wore them to dinner, to the pool, on a walking tour . . . all over the place. No wearing-in time, no blisters, no sore feet. They do take an extra moment to put on (mostly to get the straps to lay right) but that moment is very worthwhile! I could have left my other shoes at home, they were that great. I've ordered these in two more colors.Update 1/23/15: I now have 4 pairs of these. I wore them all summer long last year and well into fall. They do eventually get a little smelly from constant wear. To combat this, I wash the foot bed with yoga mat spray, and hand wash the cloth part with mild detergent. The cloth also stretches out a little over time, but not enough to affect the fit (they get easier to put on, but still stay on well). The patterned ones seem to stretch less than the solids. I get compliments on them all the time. Love my Sanuks!", "I saw someone in Vegas wearing a pair of Sanuk Yoga Slings and instantly fell in love with the style. When I bought mine, I was so excited! However, after wearing them for a couple of days I'm actually very disappointed.1. The sole is too narrow and my foot slips off when walking.2. Somehow the straps don't seem to hold the sandal to your foot so it feels as though it is flopping around your foot.Although very adorable, I would not recommend."]},

Based on the size chart I would be a L (5'6\", 38B, 138 lbs)  but I did over one size larger, the XL, because I like mine roomy and  relaxed, and also just in case the rayon shrinks, which Rayon usually does, but not much at all in this case, thank goodness.  I wish there are hidden pockets, which make this dress perfect ... but otherwise a great easy piece to wear around the house or go out.  as to the chemical smell, there is a little bit of it, but I washed mine and use a nice fabric softener, so it is much better now, not bothersome at all.", "So comfortable and flows nicely! Im 5'4, 165 and I purchased a medium and it fit me perfectly!!!!", "Comfy, cute casual summer dress. This fit great! I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d/200lbs and got the XL. It hits me just barely above the knee and looks great. The fabric is soft and not too heavy, which is perfect for August. The color is pretty much dead on to my iPhone or iPad screen. I got the Daybreak color.", "I\u2019m in love with this dress!! I ordered another one in a different color because I liked it so much. I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d, 155lbs, 34DDD and the large fit great. I could\u2019ve possibly went down to a medium (it\u2019s roomy). I like the fit though for my chest area. The material is pretty thin, but I love that for the summer. I think it\u2019ll be cute with leggings for the winter. Great buy!", "LOVE THIS DRESS! I was worried about the material maybe showing every little lump and bump, but this is great! Its flowy and not super fitted, yet still gives a good shape. The quality is comparable to that of piko clothing. The color was a little more brown than I expected, but its not like a dark brown. It still works for me. The length comes right about my knee cap, similar to the look that you see in the model. I am 5'5, 155lb, athletic build, and I purchased a medium.I am currently stocking up on some fall clothes and I plan to buy more things from this company! I was thinking about maybe even getting more of these in a different color or in long sleeve.", "I have a lot of dresses with this same material so I knew that would not be a problem. It was the style I was concerned about....but to my surprise I love this dress. I am 5'2\" 198 pounds and this dress fits my curves well on top and flairs at just the right spot for the lower half. I am planning to buy another color!!", "This dress runs pretty true to size and it's well made. I wear it to hack around on the weekends or on a very casual work day in the summer. It launders great...didn't shrink or fade at all. I liked it so much I ordered it in several other colors!  Highly recommended:-)", "This rating is based on the fact that the dress cost $18...  Well worth the money!  Super comfortable, but you can dress it up easily, too.  I am 5'7\" / 145 lbs. - M fit perfectly.  4 stars because it comes with a strong odor.  Make sure to order with enough time to let the dress air out before you wear it.", "I love this little dress. Even though its source is China, an XL fit me. (I usually wear L to XL, whichever fits.)  I read the reviews, ordered the XL, and hoped for the best. And my two Levaca styles fit me nicely, even lengthwise. I thought I would like the flowing, draping style of the other garment better but I love this one as well:  simple on top with tiered gathers on the skirt. I like the simple ease of this dress. I am 5'4\", and \"the new forty\". Was looking for something cool and casual but nice-looking to wear at home and around town this summer, with leggings, or without. The fabric on both items feels wonderful; smooth and feather-light. The construction seems well engineered, although the waist on this garment wants to place itself a bit too high on me. (Busty women might find the waist crosses the bustline.) The waist is easily adjusted to only slightly high, but short of empire, and it doesn't bother me. I ordered the dark blue, which is purple.  The darker fabric doesn't draw attention to the waist, and will be lovely with brighter accessories for summer.", "I ordered the khaki color wanting a neutral for summer in size medium.  For reference, I am 5\u20193 and 130 pounds.  The dress is adorable!  A smidge tight in the bust area but with a good bra it\u2019s fine.  I am not large busted, if you are, I would HIGHLY recommend sizing up.  The length is perfect, the tiers are cute and it\u2019s not too boxy.  Looks great with flats or dress up a bit with a heel and some long necklaces.  The color is more of a cocoa than khaki.  Overall very pleased and what a great buy, looks much more expensive on."]},
{"asin": "B078SHT9G1", "comments": ["This is a good, high quality, casual shirt. The fabric is soft and feels well made. I purchased the Apricot color. It is more of a warm, soft, golden yellow than it appears in the photo. It is a beautiful color. The fabric is a bit thin, and see-theough, so I need to wear a camisole under. I wish it were thicker, but that is my only complaint.", "I purchased this because I have been looking for tops that have REAL fabric in them.  Most women's tops have polyester, nylon, rayon, acrylic, spanx and other names the industry have created to call fabric that's not fabric.  These are petroleum-based manufactured fibers.  This top is not 100% petroleum but it, in my research of looking for ones with more real fabric this worked.  It's 97%cotton, 3%spandex but that 3% gives the top a lot of stretch.Another reason I purchased this is I was looking for a top that breathed.  The fake fabric tops don't allow the skin to breath and hold in body heat.  Not a god thing if you a warm bodied person or for women experiencing hot flushes of flashes.  I wore this shirt for the first time yesterday and it was comfortable.  I didn't get overheated or feel like the fabric was sticking to my skin.  However it is still cold here so I'll have to wait and see.  The top is plenty stretchy with jut 3% spanex.  Things I like about the top:Pros:The color:  The colors are vibrant and clear, not muted.The Cut:  The cut is tapered, not hanging like a tent like many of today's top.Less Spanx: This allows the top to be more relaxed and not fit like a second skin.The Cut: The scoop neck is not too revealing.The Cut: I like the length.  On me it's tunic length because I ordered the x-large.The Cut: Sleeve cut is nice.Cons:The Spanx:  Even though it's only 3% it could easily be less and have the same wearing experience.Fabric: It fits well but once the fabric settles it relaxes and become larger-that's because of the cotton which has a tendency to stretch out.The Fit: True to size?  What does that mean anymore?  There is a standardized size chart on most websites but there is no consistency in fit. I have ordered from Amazon clothes according to the size charts only to send them back because they didn't fit for one reason or another.  IMHO true to size means how do you want it to fit?  When I order more of this top I will order the large, but only because if I go smaller I'll lose the length I like.I would recommend this top.", "This fit great and form fitting.  I usually wear a large but ordered a extra large because of my DD cups.  The shirt stops right below the buttocks and I have a small waist with nice size hips.  I will definitely be ordering this shirt in other colors.", "I'm 5'11\" with very broad shoulders and a long torso. I recently had a baby and ordered an XL to fit my shoulders and be sightly loose over my midsection. I can also easily nurse in this shirt if that matters to anyone. This shirt is amazing! I've never loved a T-shirt this much. It's so soft and it's long, which is hard for me to find. I love this. I'm going to buy more for sure.", "I really like these blouses.  They are lightweight and nice looking.  The colors are very pretty too.  I like that the shirts are long, which is nice for people who want to detract attention from their mid-section.  I especially like the scoop neck.  I find that most T-shirts come up too high and if you are large-busted, they will just make you look fat.  The scoop neck on these pulls away from the neckline enough that it creates a really nice shape and hags well on the body.The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because the material is so light and delicate that I would recommend hand washing and hanging to dry rather than running them through a machine if you really want them to last.  On the other hand, the shirts are very inexpensive, so replacing them may not be an issue for you.  I definitely recommend.", "The first one I ordered was red in xxl.  I usually get xxl in tees because I have natural 36DDs and don't always want to have guys staring, especially at work which is where I intend to wear these.  However, the xxl was very boxy.  Pretty color, but \u2b1b.  So I figured I'd go down a size even though the difference between the xl and xxl is bigger than the difference between any of the other sizes, a 9\" difference versus a 3\" difference.  Thankfully, the xl, this time in burgundy, fits ok, not too tight in the chest so I won't feel self-conscious at work.  The red is a very vibrant and bold shade, while the burgundy has depth and warmth.  The material is soft but has weight, not that thin tissue paper-like material, and in those colors is not see-thru.  The seams are even and trim.  The shirts do come out of the dryer a little wrinkled, but that may be because I dry my clothes on \"no heat\" so they last longer.  Hanging them on hangers helps get rid of some of the wrinkles but if you fold your tees, you'll likely have a very wrinkled shirt.I intend to get more in the burgundy (for work) and some of the other colors (just cuz), in xl.", "I'm very casual and have been replacing shirts with more simple tops as my older ones have worn out. I ordered 2 of these and loved the fit so much that I ordered more. The top is form-fitting but still flattering on me. The top goes down to the top of my thigh (I am 5'5, 178 lbs and an hourglass shape). I probably could have gone a size down to a Large, but wasn't sure if it would end up too tight across my D-cups.  The shirt is easy to dress up or down depending on the occasion. Have and would repurchase!", "super comfy!  Nice &amp; long.  will purchase again &amp; think I need a L vs XL.  I am 5'1\" &amp; 140lbs", "These are a great fit. They don't cling in the underarm area and are not skin tight. I am 5'4\", 170 pounds (37ish inch waist, for reference), and I ordered the large. Not tight, and not super flow-y. I would say I am a large size in most tank tops/t-shirts, so definitely order the size that you would usually get unless you want it especially tight/loose. The colors are great and I saw no loose threads upon taking them out of the package.", "First off, if you are a person of average arm length, ignore the rest of this review and just know that this is a really nice, basic shirt.  The quality is good, the sizing seems normal, and the fabric is a nice weight and feel that looks like it should hold up to long-term wear really well.Okay, are they gone?  Right, the rest of this review is for those folks out there who, like me, have monkey arms and are constantly on quest for long enough sleeves.  Folks, I'm sad to say that this shirt is not the answer you are looking for.It seemed promising at first.  I have a long torso as well as long arms, and when I pulled the shirt on, not only did the fitted waist area actually fall at my waist (as opposed to somewhere around my ribcage as so often happens) but the hem hits right at the widest part of my hips, so I could bend and sit in this without any unwanted exposure.  Nice!  But alas!  When I tugged the sleeves down, they hit an inch above my wrist; after a bit of wear, I found that their natural ride-up position had them falling a full two inches short of my wrist.So if you are long in the arm and torso, I'd definitely consider the short-sleeved version of this shirt, but skip the long-sleeve version."]},

The colors are fantastic, and the fit is tailored nicely for females. The snap buttons make it a quick shirt to throw on, and super simple to roll or unroll the sleeves. The shirt itself is super thin and keeps you cool, while also providing excellent sun protection. I always wear one when kayaking, fishing, crabbing, etc. and never get sun burned. For size reference, I bought an XS and am 5'5\" and 120 lbs. The XS isn't too snug, and allows me extra room to move my arms around comfortably. In the picture, I'm wearing the XS white shirt. My friend is a couple inches taller and is wearing a S in cool blue. If you want a good looking, cool, sun protectant shirt, this is definitely worth a purchase.", "I ordered this shirt but ended up returning it for a few reasons. 1) There are no buttons, only white plastic snaps. To me this cheapens the look. I worry about the white plastic yellowing over time or the shirt popping open on me. 2) I ordered white because I thought it would look really fresh and cool. While I liked white, it was extremely sheer in the parts not lined with mesh. The lower back especially would show any tattoo, mole, bandaid etc. I think if you wore it really roomy, that would be okay but I was looking for a more fitted look.", "Was lost in the woods for 12 hours in this shirt. Had to slide down a mountain in it. The evidence of my slide has not completely washed out of the back, only negative. I started out with it snapped up, sleeves down and ended up with it unsnapped, sleeves up. After hiking for 12 hours in it with few stops I had no chaffed areas. If fits close like a hiking shirt should. I'm a bit hippy so things from North Face in a 12 were too slim. The woman in the store told me I needed to look at Columbia so I came home and looked on Amazon. I leave the bottom snap unsnapped just because I don't like things too snug. I'm going to hike to the bottom of the  Grand Canyon in a few days and I will not take another shirt. I'll rinse this one out that night and wear it back out the next day. It dries quickly and I washed it in the washing machine and dried it on a hanger. The stain on the back is proof that I can survive in the deep woods.

Still plenty of room to cross arms, since the back ventilation \"shawl\" is roomy--it does come down farther than most shirts like this, but seems more stylish.Big plus: FINALLY a roll-up sleeve that covers more like a 3/4 sleeve (for the M, just below the elbow for the S).  Most hit above elbow and are NOT flattering!The \"fossil\" color is sort of like the old Necco chocolate flavor wafer candy.  Will not show dirt much.The \"button-down collar\" uses velcro so tips can be easily opened to lay spread out.There are TWO zippered pockets near the waist.  These will be fabulous for travel.  (PS I threw away one shirt--another brand--that had chest pockets.  Unusable because they make you look lumpy, VERY unflattering, and if you tried to unbutton some top buttons, the mesh lining hung out like bad underwear.)AND the \"Columbia\" tag is velcro-ed so that it could hold a water tube or lip-balm.  LOVE this shirt!", "Polyester ripstop is my favorite material for shirts.  I have so many varieties of this style across several brands.  The material keeps you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  The material is soft, washes well, retains its color and doesn't wrinkle.  You can wear this shirt to the office and then step on a hiking trail after work without changing.  The sleeves fit well both rolled up or unraveled. A mesh flap in the back provides for ventilation.  These make great travel shirts because of the low maintenance.  Wash and ring them out and they dry out in a few hours.There are two side pockets above the hips for perhaps small wallet or phone or keys.  The pockets are a bit out of the way so as to not create bulk across the chest.I picked the vibrant rose red and will soon get other colors.  I noticed a large difference in price between the colors.", "This was my second columbia shirt that I purchased from amazon the first being a different material...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089FB73W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1I LOVE this shirt.

Will definitely buy more.", "I adore these cool, trim-looking shirts.  I own at least seven and am rarely out of them in the summer.  I've even slept in them on train trips and when camping.  The black is a dark, saturated color -- subtle and flattering.  Here are a few notes or quibbles about these buttery, light-as-air shirts.*I wish the brand tag wasn't so obtrusive, or better yet, not visible.  I feel the tag stands out the worst against these black shirts.  If this top wasn't branded, I would also make them my office uniform in a heart beat.  As is, I sometimes wear under cardigans, but the sweater has to be heavy enough that the tag on front doesn't show through.  I've toyed with the idea of removing it using a seam ripper, but haven't been brave enough (or found a cheap enough shirt) to risk trying it yet.  I'm not sure the fine (though durable) material would withstand the removal without showing holes/pricks.*I adore the snap buttons.  The fact that they match the shirt is part of what makes the shirt so trim/streamlined IMO.  I wish that I had discovered these shirts (assuming they existed then) when I was nursing my kids.  However, I would caution those purchasing for this use that the snaps come open VERY easily.  Handy when sporting an infant in one arm and un-buttoning with another, but probably not ideal when nursing older babies or toddlers who like to tug clothing while they sup.  A firm grab in the right spot can tear the shirt right open.  However, if paired with enough confidence or a nursing cami, these would be a great toddler/older baby nursing option as well.*I wish that the length was longer, verging into CYA territory.  Please, please, please.  I in insist that my front and rear are comfortably covered when wearing with leggings/athletic tights, so making these shirts longer would allow me to wear them with all types of bottoms.*Strangely, I need a M in the sleeveless version and a L in the short and long-sleeved versions.  No idea why, but I know it's not just me because I've seen other reviews reflecting this difference.  I normally wear a M or S.*As a bonus, the back vent camouflages bra lines and bulges."]},

It is also true to size; I am 5 foot six, slim, with a pretty large chest of about 36D, and medium fit me PERFECTLY. It was fitting around the chest, and flowy as you go down, just as a shirt like this is meant to be. I got nonstop compliments on the shirt, and several people ask me where they could buy it, even my 28-year-old daughter asked to borrow it ha ha!

Not sure how it will hold up over time.", "Nice shirt, very flattering, but it does seem to run a little large and is bigger at the bottom so it fits loosely. I got a medium but it fit me in width more like a size large would, the length was more like a medium. If it was a bit more fitted it would look better and I would give it 5 stars.

{"asin": "B071P3PQZ8", "comments": ["Note about pictures:  these are how they look after several months of wear.  I've included the Kadee next to the citilane so you can see the difference between unisex and standard sizing.I bought a pair of these in size 7 in black at the same as the size 7w citilane unisex crocs in red.  Very disparate ideas of what a size 7 is between both sandals.The citilane were very wide and chucky, and the straps ended up giving me a flew blisters.  These are vary narrow and a little undersized but are otherwise more comfortable to me and zero blisters.  These also feel a little less supportive and cushioned than the citilane, but I still find them more comfortable.I've worn them for months, and on several multi mile walks, and they've been nothing but comfortable.I figured I'd reorder in size 8 for my next pair (the lemon ones) because my heel sat a bit too close to the back on the 7.  Well, heel sits just as close on the 8 so the only difference is more length where the toes are and more width.I'm generally a size 7 to 7 and a half.  My foot is 10 inches in length from my big toe to my heel, and the widest part of my foot measures 9 inches around.", "Warning- DO NOT leave these in the sun for any length of time. When these arrived, I loved them! They fit perfect, were lightweight, and were comfortable on my feet. I took them on a beach trip the first week I had them and they did great walking in the sand and were easy to clean. The issue came when I rinsed them off and left them on the deck to dry...they shrunk. When I say say shrunk, I mean they went from a perfect size 9 to a size 6!! They were in the sun for less than 2 hours when I tried to put them on and realized that my heel was hanging off the back. I compared them with another pair I bought in a different color and could not believe how small they had become! I would give them 5 stars if it were not for the incredible shrinkage.", "I really wanted a pair of summer sandals that I could wear all day without dying of foot and leg pain at the end of the day and I know from experience the foot bed of the croc shoe is very comfy.  I also didn't want to break the bank. Problem is, I normally wear a size 8 but every size 8 croc's I've ever tried are too long for my feet, leaving more than a full inch of space from end of toe to tip of shoe. This causes me to trip over my own toes or 'drag' the toe every so often, so I no longer buy size 8 croc's. I also need a wide shoe and must beware of  multiple straps because they can pinch and bind in all the wrong places.  I decided on the tried and true flip flop, as they can usually accommodate wide feet due to the basic \"openness\" of the shoe. I took a chance and ordered down to a size 7 and glad I did because size 8 would have been way to long. I do wish the flops offered a little more arch support as I have high arches, but all in all, they are working out well. The back of my heel sits right at the heel cup and there is still room at the toe as you can see in the pics. I love the squishy bouncy feel of the shoe when walking or standing. I broke one of my toes before these arrived and will be wearing them daily until my toe heals.  FYI, I deducted one star for lack of half sizes and one star for mediocre arch support.", "I decided to go one size up and they fit perfect! I normally order size 8 in sandals that have no half sizes but after reading reviews, I decided to go with a 9. I wear 8.5 in closed toe shoes and 8 in sandals. So go with a 9 if you normally wear an 8 or an 8.5. These shoes are a whole size off. I owned and loved my Kadee originals but my puppy chewed them up last week and I thought I could get another pair and they were no longer available. The Kadee 2's are just as comfortable on day one. The Kadee originals, I had to wear for a couple weeks and got a blister and then they fit well. These are good right out of the box. They are not as arch supportive as the originals but they will do. These feel a bit thinner.  Although, I am still looking for another pair to wear around the house on tile floors. These do have a bit of arch support but for flat floors, I feel I need a bit more. The price on these is a winner. I would buy them again, good shopping shoe but not all day support. If you have lower back problems like I do from gluten allergies and looking for all day wear on cement floors get another style. Good garden shoe, easy rinse and go.", "My daughter needed shower shoes for college dorm use,  and these are  perfect for that: all rubber so they dry quickly, grippy bottom and inside, wide enough. But as for wearing them as regular flip-flops: probably not. They are very thin and flexible---if you walk too fast, the front edge can catch on the ground and bend completely under your foot, tripping you---and the raised-dot pattern on the soles is uncomfortable to walk or stand in for long periods of time.She normally wears a size 10, but ordered 11 in these so they'd be loose enough for easy showering. Good thing, because even with the full size up, her heel is right at the back!", "While I LOVE these sandals and the colors they come in, I had to return the first two pairs on Amazon because they were too small in my size. Bought my third in one size up from Crocs and one more from Amazon. That worked, but I noticed something strange. The pair from Crocs site and the one from Amazon are different. Amazon pair is loose from the toe and where the strap sits and the one from Crocs in snug. The width is visibly different, too. I bought it here for the color. Not sure if these are original. I'm keeping them, though.", "I purchased these flip flops specifically for beach/pool wear. I was storing them in my car to have handy. On a day trip to the beach I reached for them to find that they had shrunk up to the size of something that would fit a toddler. Very disappointed. Beware.", "I recently wound up with a foot injury, needing more arch support and cushion in my shoes. I love wearing flip flops in the summer, whether to the beach, to muck around in the garden, or just kicking around town. Unfortunately, my old flip flops just killed my feet- I would have horrible pain even after taking out the garbage. I ordered these Crocs flip flops hoping they would be a better option, and they certainly are! The are very lightweight, surprisingly supportive for a flip flop, and a little bit cushy. As long as I am not walking or on my feet all day, they are comfortable for hours! My only minor disappointment was the color. I ordered bronze, thinking they would be the same dark gold, slightly sparkly color of the Crocs Mary Janes I had a few years back, but they are just a dark tan color. I do love that they are easy to clean through!", "Soooo disappointed. Bought these 3 yrs ago, been wearing them since then...right out of the box. Great flip flop. The thong part popped on the right one. So I ordered the same pair, same size. Hit \"order again\". What I received was shorter, tighter, and feels hard. I put the old one next to the new one. The new one is not the same. The design inside of the flip flop is different. There is no crocodile in the heel bed. No wiggle room. I have wide feet and these are not comfortable. I'll try gorilla glue on the old ones. Btw, I ordered the size 11 for \"end of work day comfort\", and literally hit \"order again\". So disappointing...smh.", "I ordered theses in size 8W/6M for myself who is somewhere between 7.5 and 8 in laides shoes.  These shoes are way too small.  Since they fit my moer who wear a size 6.5.  Asidefrom being to small, the quality is nothing impressive.  Not horrible but nothing near the quality the old Crocs were.  The Crocs I bought 7 years ago are soft, thick, durable and true to size.  My last couple puchases with Crocs were nothing but disappointing."]},

I'm 5' 3\" and 190 lbs. so I'm kind of short and stout, but I have an hourglass figure. I like my tops a little loose fitting, but not really loose. I ordered XL because other reviewers around my size said it worked for them but these are pretty loose on me. If I had tried these on in a store, I probably would have bought large instead. However, I'm happy with the quality of the shirts and I'm too lazy to exchange them. They're pretty stretchy and I like that they're a bit long.

I might have fit into a small but have broad shoulders (and thick waistline) and prefer a little room.", "My daughter and I purchased 6 of these tops for our 5 week trip to India. We wore them constantly and washed them almost daily. After hand washing and wringing, we simply hung them on a hanger and they dried quickly and wrinkle-free. Even the ribbing around the neck kept it's shape! They also breathed well and were so comfortable to wear. We were originally going to pitch them after we got back but they are still in such great shape and so comfortable I think we will be wearing them for a long time.", "Ordered the 2-pack of white in size Small based off reviews and that is the correct size. I'm 5'6\", 34B bra size, size 4-6 in shirts (usually a small), 28\" waist (usually 28 in premium denim and size 6 in pants), and somewhat pear shaped due to having narrower shoulders and wider hips.I would give this shirt 5 stars for quality of the material at this price point. I love a modal blend and this shirt is soft and smooth, but not tissue thin. You do need to wear a nude bra with the white, but the material has a nice heft to it.The V neckline is moderate and there's no danger of cleavage or full coverage bras peeking above the neckline for me.I took off a star because this shirt is extremely long. You can see in one of the photos on the model that it's almost covering her behind. I would have to stretch the shirt to actually cover mine, but this definitely hits well below the start of the hip and I have an average length torso. I would say that this shirt fits like it was made as a tall. Ladies that are 5'4\" or shorter should be prepared for this to be tunic length.You can sort of tell from the photos that this shirt is cut to taper in slightly at the waist and then flare out across the hips. I find this flattering and I would say it fits in the bust and waist as shown in photos. If you have slim/narrow hips, then this shirt won't fit right on you.I purchased these shirts to be able to tuck into pants and they are certainly easy to do that since they are so long, although the shirt does end quite a bit beneath my pants' waistline.Note: I could have sized down to an X-Small and still have the shirt fit in the shoulders, bust, and waist, but I'm confident it would be very tight around the hips. I'm ok with it being only slightly fitted (as shown on model) and staying with the Small. But if you're hoping for a more fitted look, then this shirt isn't for you.UPDATE September 25, 2018: I wore these shirts tucked into belted jeans and pants throughout the summer and came to really love them. Fit stayed the same after numerous washes (I was on cold and dry on low heat). The material did not pill, but it's not as smooth and perfect as when I first purchased, which is to be expected. I still think the shirt should be slightly shorter, but I've come to like how I can tuck these shirts into any rise of pants. I'll be purchasing more of these 2-packs in the spring for next summer.", "Great quality, not see through.  I got the small and it fits perfectly-not too tight and not too loose.

Great shirt for the price.", "Pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality.  Nicely weighted soft shirts!  Bought this on Prime Day, so the $12 price point was in line for what I'd usually pay for a simple V neck.  Additionally, I am really thrilled at how opaque the white shirt is.

I ended up purchasing the large and glad I did.  The shirt is not your typical cotton t.  It feels much more top of the line...an expensive feel without an expensive cost.  It has a spandex blend so it has some stretch.  Not paper thin so you don\u2019t have to wear a tank under it.  The v neck is perfect.  I love the v neck look, but hate when they are low cut.  This one is a high cut v which i prefer.  Wore it for the first time at work (I\u2019m a Elementary Teacher) and had many compliments and people asking where I got it so they could purchase one.  The price was right too.  Definitely looking into other shirts with this same quality and material!!", "After reading the reviews, I bought both a small and medium shirt. The shirt fabric is not your typical 95% cotton/5% spandex. The shirt is not normal t-shirt material and has a very boxy and short fit.

It doesn't - it runs true to size. I am 5`10, normally a size 18W no more no less. I ordered a 3X, I think (if I remember correctly), so I should have just gotten the 2X. I personally didn't care for the style and cut for my current body shape and size. I am largely built, but more or less proportional with a large chest, so I prefer a-line tops that hug the chest and have a gentle taper down to the waist. It wasn't as fitted as I'd like to be, but if I lost weight I might like the style better. Other than that, the top was beautifully made - looks more expensive than it is, soft fabric, rich full color and had a nice swing to it. Fair warning, if you are plus-sized and top heavy, it might make you look a little boxy. I do recommend both the brand and the seller.

I am about 5'6 and range from 150-160 lbs. And the large fit me, perfectly. I wanted baggy. And it is baggy, but not overly baggy. Enough to pull the side down, on the shoulder. I can even knot it on the side and it's still baggy. A medium would have fit me, perfectly, but the look I was going for, needed baggy. This shirt is just so cute and you couldn't beat the price for $14. AND it came nicely folded in a heavier zip block bag. Which sounds silly, but it's nice it wasn't just thrown in an envelope.", "So this is nice enough...I guess.  Thez material is awfully thin.

When I received it I was super surprised.  The material is amazing.  It is so soft and just feels perfect on my skin.  I do wish it came off the shoulder in a more baggy way but that Is just because I bought it to where it was the perfect fit I believe next time I will get a size bigger so that I can have one to laze around in and etc.  However, the size I got was perfect and I love it a lot.

I like that the shirt is longer than most Ts, which pairs nicely with leggings. I'm 5'6, 190lbs with a gut and ordered the XL.The colors are kind of muted, with the 'purple' being more of a periwinkle in good lighting. The blue is your standard navy.The material is on the thicker side, so i plan on saving the shirts for the end of summer/fall. It'll pair well with items that will give belly coverage like a hoodie, jean jacket, or cardigan. I wouldn't order again, but I'm not considering a return either.", "I absolutely love them. I had read a lot of reviews, but I was still genuinely surprised at the quality of the material as soon as I opened the package. The material has some weight to it - doesn't feel cheap, thin or flimsy at all, and is soft to the touch. Be warned though on hot humid days it'll really cling to you if you're sweating a lot.The fit is perfect for what I wanted. I ended up getting the xxl because I wanted it to be huge on me and it did not disappoint - it goes well past my hips and fits very loose. I wanted something that was comfortable to do some working out in and lounging in and these turned out to be perfect. The color is absolutely beautiful as well. As soon as I got these and tried them I had immediately ordered another set!

I ordered this in xsmall after looking at the photos and other reviews. 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating but that wasn't an option so I bumped it up instead of down due to the nice fabric.The bad: It does my figure NO favors. I don't like tight t shirts but ones that just have a little bit of shape that hint at there being a female form underneath and not a cardboard box. Unfortunately this tshirt gives me a \"shoebox\" body shape. I've attached a photo of how it hangs naturally vs when I pull it back at the waist so show how my body is actually shaped. If it was just tapered in around the waist even a tad more I'd be much happier with the silhouette.The good : It's SUPER SOFT. Extremely comfortable. The sleeves are the perfect length in my opinion. The neckline is also perfect for a casual tshirt. Not constricting at all but not flashy either. Great length. I'm wearing a nude bra underneath in my photos and I could not see it at all through the shirt. It has a nice thickness, but as you can see at the bottom you can see my shorts through it so don't expect to be able to wear a black bra without noticing it.All in all I think I will keep these as \"around the house\" shirts since they are affordable and so comfortable.

Very stretchy and they are a little long but I am short. Get these though! You won\u2019t be sorry!", "The material is soft and not thin - two important qualities I look for in a casual T.  I like the round-neck slightly better than the 'v' only because the latter tends to stretch in the collar a little.  I recommend sizing down if you have a smaller chest; otherwise, order the size you would normally get.", "I needed a few nice basic tees to round out my wardrobe.  I ordered these and a 2 pack of the v-neck as well, based on reviews I went with a medium.  I'm 5'5 140 lbs and 34B and the medium fit loose and was just too boxy for me, I'm going to reorder in small to see if it's a more flattering and feminine fit.  The fabric is nice and light, not too spandex-y like workout tops.  As to the white being see through- I was wearing a nude bra and could not see it, however the waistband of my black pants was clearly visible through it, so if that sort of thing bugs you these probably wouldnot bee good for you. They were long (mid hip), but I personally like alittle extra coverage over my hips especially with skinny jeans. The fit of these really reminded me of Old Navy - the vanity sizing kings of retail.  I always get size small in tops there, if that helps anyone.", "These shirts are a really great deal - much thicker and higher quality than I was expecting! There's even some stretch to the fabric. The length is slightly long - not quite enough to cover my butt like a tunic, but still a skosh longer than most of my other t-shirts, which might be nice for people with longer torsos (For reference, I'm a little over 5'4). As for sizing, I'm a pretty solid L-XL in shirts, but as I like my t-shirts to fit a little looser I went for an XL here and they fit just how I wanted, so I'd say these are true to size.

I'm also happy to tell you that it's almost exactly like a J.Jill white t-shirt I bought years ago, and of course J.Jill never made one like it since then. It's the same cut, same fabric, and quality of stitching. And of course this one is far less expensive and doesn't have a pocket like the J.Jill.

Depending on the shoe brand, I usually fall between a 7 and 7.5. Some reviews said they ran small, so I ordered these in 7.5. I probably should have gotten a 7.

Something was just off, and too much of it. Then I went online and read the reviews... my hunch was right. These are fakes.

I requested the large, because I vastly prefer my clothes to be too loose as opposed to too tight.  The large looks fine, but I think a medium would've fit even better.  If--make that \"when\"--I order this in different colors, I'll choose the medium.  [Edited to add:  I did indeed order a green dress in medium, and the fit was in fact better.  I also noticed that the price had increased to $18 since I wrote my review.  Not quite the incredible bargain, but still a good price for such a comfortable and flexible dress.)Another benefit of this dress:  I think it's perfect for traveling.  It will roll or fold up very compactly and seems impossible to wrinkle.In short, I think this dress will receive heavy use in my rotation of summer dresses.

Both items have the same description and brand (Maidenform one fab fit t-shirt bra), and yet if you look at the photos I submitted there is a HUGE size discrepancy. Both are supposedly 36DD, and yet the band on the black bra is an entire 1.5 inches shorter! I am going to need to exchange the black for a longer band unfortunately. Also the fact that the labels are completely different for the same model makes me wonder about the authenticity of the brand. One is made in Bangladesh, the other in El Salvador. One has (R) by the brand name (white bra) and the other (TM/MC) (black bra) which leads me to believe the black one is a knock-off.", "Giving 3 stars due to inconsistent sizing. The one bra that did fit gets 5 stars. I was delighted to see these here after buying one at a store. I ordered black, blush, Moroccan blue, and beige. Sadly, only the Moroccan blue bra fit perfectly like the one I bought in store. The others were made of different materials that were not as comfortable and the bands were actually much shorter (I'm talking 1-2\" difference). I would have needed to use those extenders at the biggest setting to be able to wear them, so I returned the 3 that were unbearably tight. The Amazon refund was speedy and return shipping was indeed free, so those were pluses. It's unfortunate that the sizing is so inconsistent because when you do happen upon one that actually fits as it should, these are really comfortable.", "Maidenform style #7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape.  I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price.  I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store.  This new style is an oddly molded half bra that doesn't look natural under clothing - creating points where there shouldn't be any.  I've worn the same size and style for many years, and this product did not live up to the standard.", "Yes, it fits well and looks good but one of the two bras I ordered was too scratchy to wear- threads were bunched up in the back strap at one place which made it unbearable after a few hours of wear. When I went to return this bra (and keep the other), I discovered that not only was there no free return shipping but that there is a \"15% restocking fee\" that makes the bra not worth returning.", "I bought this in the black with the heart print.  I bought the Maidenform women\u2019s natural boost Demi bra (different style) at the same time. Comparing the two,  this bra is much more cheaply made then the natural boost demi bra.  The bra fit perfectly, and the print is cute. However, the fabric doesn\u2019t feel as silky as the natural boost Demi bra by Maidenform.  The sides of this bra are not lined, but the natural boost Demi bra is. They are both about the same price. I am going to return this one and get another natural boost Demi bra. One upside to this bra is that it has minimal padding, so it feels very natural. The natural boost Demi bra has a little bit more padding, but not too much in my opinion. But when I put on the other bra, it felt luxurious. When I put on this bra, it felt cheap.Another bra I bought at the same time that feels luxurious and has the more subtle padding like this bra is the Calvin Klein demi bra. It it lovely and about the same price as well. All from Amazon!", "First of all this is the first time since I can remember that I really do have a need for a bra. I have been very, very \u2018small\u2019 and could get away with wearing just a camisole under a top (sometimes not even that). For years I used to hate wearing a bra, perhaps it was a result of my not buying the correct size and style. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d and about 103 pounds - give or take a couple and do need some coverage on the top. This style was the first one I tried and I used the sizing that was given to find my correct size (34C). I didn\u2019t realize it was an underwire bra but when I tried it on the wire didn\u2019t even feel uncomfortable. I liked this bra style so much that I bought several additional ones (all in basic colors like black, white, nude, navy). The style is cut low and I guess that\u2019s the reason it\u2019s called a t-shirt bra. The shoulder straps are adjustable and the clasp in the back has 3 different positions, depending on how \u2018wide\u2019 you need it to be (for me I was most comfortable with it on the first clasp, making it the widest). I won\u2019t even say how much (or how little!) these cost - at least when I bought them. There isn\u2019t anything that I would consider negative and would definitely recommend this style for everything, not only t-shirts!", "Cute bra.  Love the polka-dots.  I ordered it to replace a similar Maidenform model which I could not find in the correct size.  This bra is slightly smaller in fit than the other slightly different models I was replacing and that I ordered at the same time.  Both the band and the cups are smaller than expected, but not so much that I can't wear it.  Although it won't be my favorite.", "I bought this because I thought it would be a cute bra for cheap. I shouldn't have. This is the strangest fitting bra I've ever put on. The material is really cheap and scratchy, and the straps, although let ALL the way out, were so short that they were digging into my shoulders. For reference, I'm a 38DD, 5'4, size L-XL in tops. It was a STRUGGLE to even get this thing clasped on the loosest hook. Once on, it smashed my boobs down, created a WEIRD looking point (I like a more natural shape, but this made it look like my nipples were right underneath my collarbone). It was cut REALLY high up but the top of my boob was still bulging out, creating a *lovely* quad-boob effect. It's honestly the most ill-fitting garmet I've ever worn.Just... Don't. Don't waste your money."]},

I know this will be one of my favorite shirts to wear because it's so comfy and makes me feel style, cute, and comfortable!If you are well endowed in the bust area, I definitely would size up.

I am bummed to say that I had to return them because they looked so cute in the pictures and had good reviews. The primary reason I sent these tops back is because they were sewn so sloppily that the stripes in the middle were not lined up and were crooked. It was very obvious that someone in a factory spit this top out in 5 minutes. I realize it isn\u2019t an expensive shirt and my expectations weren\u2019t super high but it looked really bad and obvious. Because the stripes are in the middle where the waist is your eye is drawn right to it. Secondly, the draping of this shirt is straight down and was very unflattering on my particular shape. I am 5\u20197, 190 lbs, 38DD with a small waist and above average sized hips. This top hangs loose and straight down and does not hug your curves at all and makes my hourglass shape look larger and curveless.

The fabric is a loosely woven type of fabric, so although thicker than normal t-shirt material, it will be great for summer.  The yellow color is bright and vibrant.  I washed this in the washer, and tumbled dry on low, and it came out fine, and didn't shrink.  If you have any kind of a tummy, it probably won't hang straight and loose on you, like it does on the model, so keep that in mind as you choose your size.

Because of its potential to shrink I will be washing it on cold delicate and air drying this for sure. A lot of work for a t-shirt.  I considered sending it back but I like the print too much.

The white shirt is transparent to the point of being inappropriate when worn alone and would need to be worn as a layer. That said, there are several redeeming qualities for this shirt. The first is that they make an excellent undershirt and are very thin and breathable for that purpose.

I ordered a larger size expecting it to be super oversized and it wasn\u2019t which makes me believe it has a smaller fit. Other than all of that I like it.", "At first I was a little disappointed.  But then it grew on me after I wore it. I'm 5'11 and got the XL. Sizing is always tough for me because of my height. The sleeves are looser than I would like (but again it's an XL) over all I really like it and the back is still longer in the back for me. It's a great price compared to the boutiques.", "This top is very soft, light, and comfortable. I ordered the \u201crust red\u201d color in a small and it is pretty perfect size wise for me. For reference I am 5\u20192\u201d 135lbs. I didn\u2019t want it to be skin tight since I like to tuck the front of my shirts in. I have no intentions to tie the front as pictured so I will be happy to tuck the two front pieces into my jeans. My only complaints are that 1. It will probably snag easily. And 2. The buttons are pretty spaced out (a cami can fix this and I always wear a cami under my shirts so no big deal). Someone else mentioned that the button holes were hard to find and I kind of laughed when I read that wondering how it\u2019s hard to find a button hole?! I get it now. They arent outlined with thread it\u2019s just a hole cut in the shirt so you kind of have to check for them.", "I honestly can't believe how much I love this super-cute top!  It feels wonderful on and looks adorable.  I think I will order another to have on hand as a spare in case I ruin this one!"]},
{"asin": "B07F9DR4XJ", "comments": ["Although I wish that these shirts were drifit I can't really complain because the price was really good and I didn't want to spend the money for something I'm going to use as an under shirt. I bought these to cover up my tattoos for work and medic school and they work great! Not see through at all and very comfortable. I purchased a medium and it's not too tight or loose, just right! Here's my stats for you to help pick the fight size I'm 5'7 140lbs waist 26.5 inches and I'm approx 17% BF. I have small boobs (34B) even if you have larger breast a medium should still fit in the top...i have extra room. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I am 5'7\", 155 lbs, 34 DDD bust. I wear a size 8 or medium comfortably, not into tight clothing. After reading the reviews that stated this product runs small I bought the 2XL. The 2XL fits very respectful not too tight not too loose. It is 95% cotton so I am expecting slight shrinkage when it is washed but I can tell it will still be very flattering.", "I have chest 31' and I am really short, Im 4'11. I ordered size S and I thought it would be big for me, but it fits well, the only detail is that the material is thin, looks a little transparent, these shirts are comfortable for summer.", "These are the best long sleeved tee's that I've ever gotten. The shirts have the perfect amount of stretch and are more fitted than normal shirts, and the quality is great! The three pack is a steal, and I'll probably be ordering more because they're so comfortable. The white shirt isn't see through when you're wearing a nude bra. It is a good idea to order a couple of sizes bigger than you normally wear. I'm 5'1\", 125 lbs, 34C, and I usually wear a small/medium in shirts. I ordered the large in these, and they fit perfectly.", "Much smaller than one would expect. I'm usually a size M (size 6/8) and the L was super tight, hard to even try on. Material stretched thin too... made of thin material. It's an okay top.", "This shirt was exactly what I wanted!! It's a nice color, and the material is very soft. It's kinda thin material which is what I wanted, but it's not too thin that it's see through. It looked super small when I opened it , I was like \"ugh this is gunna be too small\", but it's VERY stretchy so it was perfect. I like my shirts to be skin tight though. If you don't like that, then order a size up ! I am 5'4 &amp; 157 lbs and I ordered a small. Haven't washed it yet though, so I'm hoping it doesn't shrink .. I'll probably hang to dry instead of putting it in the dryer because I don't need it anymore tighter than it already is.", "I'm 5'1 and 110lbs. I ordered a Medium. It is certainly long enough but is VERY tight in the arms and torso. I'm very petite in the bust so I pity the gal who is average or above in that area!  The length of the V neck is really long - I don't know what body type they had in mind when they constructed this top. The fabric is totally see through. I'm sorry I purchased it.", "After reading reviews to go a size up I ordered a large. I\u2019m usually a shmedium. 5\u20194 125. Large fits PERFECT. I bought these to wear under scrubs but they are perfect for casual wear too. My fabric isn\u2019t as thin as others described I think it\u2019s a little warm/perfect bc I\u2019m a cozy queen. Very happy with my purchase ! Will order again in deferent colors. Was delivered really quick. Happy happy", "I am between a small and a medium normally, but after reading several reviews I decided to go with the large. Most said I should go with a medium but seeing the pictures of other buyers and how they looked I decided to go with the large. I love the fit of this shirt. The material is perfect, it is 8% spandex and 92% cotton. I like the extra spandex in the shirt because it makes it more stretchy and holds the shape. The length of it is a little longer, which I love, the bust firs perfect, and the sleeves have a little extra length at the end which I also like very much. I recently went from 163 pounds to 125 pounds. My bust is a 36D, my waist is a 31.5, and my hips are 37 inches. I ordered the gray and charcoal. The charcoal looks a little like purple to me which is what I wanted. I am going to buy more of these shirts.", "I\u2019m normally a large but after reading about how almost everyone needed to size up I went ahead and ordered the XL. For reference I\u2019m 163 lbs with a 42 inch chest and 31 inch waist. I\u2019m not swimming in it but this shirt is supposed to be fitted and it\u2019s baggy around the waist. Had taken it on a trip so didn\u2019t have time to return but will attempt to shrink in the dryer."]},
{"asin": "B078SLD8SP", "comments": ["The overall quality of this t-shirt is about what you'd expect, with the only complaint being the size. I bought this for my teenage daugther who is quite tall for her age. She fits into an Adult small most of the time, but this one didn't even come close. Had to reorder a Medium, and we'll see how that goes. Fortunately, the return process on Amazon is a breeze and hassle-free. The package that is sent is resealable for returns. If you're considering the purchase, you might want to err on the cautious side and order the next size up from what you usually get.", "I\u2019ve been searching for a classic Friends shirt... this one is perfect! I agree, it is junior size so size up if you want it to fit a little loose. I\u2019m 130lbs B cup and went MD, could not fit better. The fabric is stretchy and cool, not typical cotton. I absolutely love the feel. The logo isn\u2019t so cheap that it comes apart in the washer, which is important to me! This is the perfect white tee for Friends fans.", "The shirt is a great quality not cheaply made. Runs a lil small so I went up a size. I usually wear 1x and ordered a 2x and it fits the way I like It.  The shirt is not a stretch type of material", "Looooooooove this shirt! I love the material! It was perfect! I knew when I saw this shirt my friends and I had to have them.", "I loove it \u2764\ufe0f.  Material is good and fitting is perfect.  Well made quality and look expensive. I wear size M but I ordered Size L and it fit great! it depends on how you like to wear.  If you like tight fitting then order the true size.", "this tshirt is very good quality, I can tell it will hold up well and not fade as fast as other black tshirts. this is not your typical cotton tshirt. It's not super stretchy, and has a more narrow fit.  My daughter is wearing xs in womens, but I ordered her a Medium (so she can wear it as a sleep shirt).  I thought that if I sized up 2 sizes, it would be super baggy. It's not. She actually could wear this shirt out and about. So I recommend definitely sizing up at least 1 size when you buy this shirt.  Having said all this, she LOVES this.", "Super SUPER nice fabric. It's not made of the cheap cotton tees, this shirt is super comfortable and feels so nice, almost like dry fit. I've received many compliments on this shirt already. Just love how it fits and feels. I'm usually a S/M in shirts, I decided to order a medium just because i wanted it a little loose, and i think there's room but just enough. Would recommend, just because it's made really well. I threw it in the washer just once, and the wording has not fell off, not sure if it ever will, but i will come back to update if it ever does!", "Very cute shirt. I order the black one in xxl and I usually wear an xl. I like it... I dont love it. It's a little snug. The material is kinda heavy and very stretchy almost kinda what leggings are made of. It feels hot. Granted, I did order the black style, but it just feels heavy. It clings to every curve you got so if you're pretty slender and like that fit, this would be perfect for you. A little disappointed as I wanted this to be really baggy on me for everyday wear....", "So I originally had this shirt in white (not good when dealing with kids at work) from urban outfitters. They did not have black which is what I really wanted. Kohls only sells online but for men. When I saw this on Amazon I had to get it. I'm a med but w muffin top I prefer a large yet decided to get XL instead. I am so happy I did. It fit perfectly. Snug enough for boobs yet loose enough for muffin top without looking like you borrowed your hubby's shirt.", "Omg! I love it! I am a 40DDD woman and I bought an XXL. I usually only wear an XL but after I read some reviews, people recommended to get a size up, so I did. But honestly, I wish I just got an XL because I kind of like a more fitted style. The XXL I got gives me a nice, decent baggy look though. So choose your style &amp; this is just my opinion. Overall, I love it! The material is nice and reasonably stretchy! It's comfortable! I will definitely purchase this again in the future! Plus, I'm a HUGE Friends fan, and I've been meaning to get one of these shirts, so I'm definitely excited to wear it more often to REPRESENT! :)"]}
